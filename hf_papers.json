Unfortunately, the pursuit of a long context is accompanied by numerous obstacles. Nevertheless, long context remains a core competitive advantage for LLMs. In the past two years, the context length of LLMs has achieved a breakthrough extension to millions of tokens. Moreover, the research on long-context LLMs has expanded from length extrapolation to a comprehensive focus on architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation technologies.   Inspired by the symphonic poem, Thus Spake Zarathustra, we draw an analogy between the journey of extending the context of LLM and the attempts of humans to transcend its mortality. In this survey, We will illustrate how LLM struggles between the tremendous need for a longer context and its equal need to accept the fact that it is ultimately finite. To achieve this, we give a global picture of the lifecycle of long-context LLMs from four perspectives: architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation, showcasing the full spectrum of long-context technologies. At the end of this survey, we will present 10 unanswered questions currently faced by long-context LLMs. We hope this survey can serve as a systematic introduction to the research on long-context LLMs.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.17129", "date_published": "2025-02-25T03:27:11"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.17258", "image": "", "title": "VideoGrain: Modulating Space-Time Attention for Multi-grained Video Editing", "content_text": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video generation and editing capabilities. However, multi-grained video editing, which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications, remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-) attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region interference in self-attention.

Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch.

A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that unify audio understanding and generation. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances.

Focusing on diverse reasoning tasks in general domains and insufficient evaluation on code tasks (e.g., only covering code generation task), where the difficulty of queries is relatively easy (e.g., the code queries of CriticBench are from Humaneval and MBPP).

Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose Great LoRA Mixture-of-Expert (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance.

Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although \"thinking LLMs\" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting inconsistencies confined to a single modality, particularly in text, but struggle with cross-modal conflicts and complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning.

In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2times extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner.

Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical l_2-norm statistics; and (3) inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to 2 perplexity.

We deconstruct access along three axes: resourcing, technical usability, and utility. Within each category, a set of variables per system component clarify tradeoffs. For example, resourcing requires access to computing infrastructure to serve model weights. We also compare the accessibility of four high performance language models, two open-weight and two closed-weight, showing similar considerations for all based instead on access variables. Access variables set the foundation for being able to scale or increase access to users; we examine the scale of access and how scale affects ability to manage and intervene on risks.

Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores.

To address these challenges, we propose M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework for AGI quality assessment that is Multimodal, Multi-Round, and Multi-Aspect. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as joint text and image encoders and distills advanced captioning capabilities from online MLLMs into a local model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. The framework includes a structured multi-round evaluation mechanism, where intermediate image descriptions are generated to provide deeper insights into the quality, correspondence, and authenticity aspects. To align predictions with human perceptual judgments, a predictor constructed by an xLSTM and a regression head is incorporated to process sequential logits and predict Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M3-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively capturing nuanced aspects of AGI quality. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation confirms its strong generalizability.

However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

The direct construction of the Brownian sphere is via a continuous analogue of the Cori--Vauquelin--Schaeffer (CVS) bijection. The CVS bijection maps labeled trees to planar maps, and the continuous version maps Aldous' continuum random tree with Brownian labels (the Brownian snake) to the Brownian sphere. In this work, we describe the inverse of the continuous CVS bijection, by constructing the Brownian snake as a measurable function of the Brownian sphere. Special care is needed to work with the orientation of the Brownian sphere.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13074", "date_published": "2025-02-25T09:03:39"}]}
