In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks.

We introduce Talking Characters, a more realistic task to generate talking character animations directly from speech and text. Unlike talking head, Talking Characters aims at generating the full portrait of one or more characters beyond the facial region. In this paper, we propose MoCha, the first of its kind to generate talking characters. To ensure precise synchronization between video and speech, we propose a speech-video window attention mechanism that effectively aligns speech and video tokens. To address the scarcity of large-scale speech-labeled video datasets, we introduce a joint training strategy that leverages both speech-labeled and text-labeled video data, significantly improving generalization across diverse character actions. We also design structured prompt templates with character tags, enabling, for the first time, multi-character conversation with turn-based dialogue-allowing AI-generated characters to engage in context-aware conversations with cinematic coherence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including human preference studies and benchmark comparisons, demonstrate that MoCha sets a new standard for AI-generated cinematic storytelling, achieving superior realism, expressiveness, controllability and generalization.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23307", "date_published": "2025-04-01T02:16:45"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24235", "image": "", "title": "What, How, Where, and How Well?

Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24235", "date_published": "2025-04-01T03:07:27"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24290", "image": "", "title": "Open-Reasoner-Zero: An Open Source Approach to Scaling Up Reinforcement\n  Learning on the Base Model", "content_text": "We introduce Open-Reasoner-Zero, the first open source implementation of large-scale reasoning-oriented RL training focusing on scalability, simplicity and accessibility.

Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than 17times sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.

Based on the DiT video generation model, we propose a memory-efficient control structure with sketch control blocks that predict residual features of skipped DiT blocks. Sketches are drawn on one or two keyframes (at arbitrary time points) for easy interaction. To propagate such temporally sparse sketch conditions across all frames, we propose an inter-frame attention mechanism to analyze the relationship between the keyframes and each video frame.

However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers.

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion.

However, its applicability to broader domains remains underexplored. In this work, we study the extension of RLVR to more diverse domains such as medicine, chemistry, psychology, and economics. We observe high agreement in binary judgments across different large language models (LLMs) when objective reference answers exist, which challenges the necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward models. To address the limitations of binary rewards when handling unstructured reference answers, we further incorporate model-based soft scoring into RLVR to improve its flexibility. Our experiments show that a distilled generative reward model can serve as an effective cross-domain verifier, providing reliable reward signals for RL without requiring domain-specific annotations. By fine-tuning a base 7B model using various RL algorithms against our reward model, we obtain policies that outperform state-of-the-art open-source aligned LLMs such as Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by a large margin, across domains in free-form answer settings.

However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit \"reasoning\" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics.

While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only 2.5% trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality. Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and generalize well for challenging text input.

In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

Despite this, we observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs. Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance. The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In addition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we also experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading criteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

It utilizes only image data, allowing models to automatically generate questions and conduct peer review assessments of answers from other models, effectively alleviating the reliance on human workload.

These include extremely slow generation speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we introduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh generation, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete triangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a transformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens and decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the diffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology, MeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds compared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an 800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35times faster than existing baselines). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset and demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset.

However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

These paths capture step-by-step logical processes while requiring only the correct answer for supervision. The self-training method has been shown to be effective in reasoning tasks while eliminating the need for external models and manual annotations. However, optimizing the use of self-generated data for model training remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Entropy-Based Adaptive Weighting for Self-Training (EAST), an adaptive weighting strategy designed to prioritize uncertain data during self-training. Specifically, EAST employs a mapping function with a tunable parameter that controls the sharpness of the weighting, assigning higher weights to data where the model exhibits greater uncertainty. This approach guides the model to focus on more informative and challenging examples, thereby enhancing its reasoning ability. We evaluate our approach on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Empirical results show that, while the vanilla method yields virtually no improvement (0%) on MATH, EAST achieves around a 1% gain over backbone model. On GSM8K, EAST attains a further 1-2% performance boost compared to the vanilla method.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23913", "date_published": "2025-04-01T09:17:10"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22668", "image": "", "title": "Understanding Co-speech Gestures in-the-wild", "content_text": "Co-speech gestures play a vital role in non-verbal communication. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-text-speech associations: (i) gesture-based retrieval, (ii) gestured word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal speech-text-video-gesture representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs), across all three tasks. Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture-related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space.
