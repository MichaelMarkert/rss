BAGEL is a unified, decoder0only model pretrained on trillions of tokens curated from large0scale interleaved text, image, video, and web data. When scaled with such diverse multimodal interleaved data, BAGEL exhibits emerging capabilities in complex multimodal reasoning. As a result, it significantly outperforms open-source unified models in both multimodal generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation.

We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks.

Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13438", "date_published": "2025-05-21T08:06:34"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14460", "image": "", "title": "VisualQuality-R1: Reasoning-Induced Image Quality Assessment via\n  Reinforcement Learning to Rank", "content_text": "DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment.

While more layers can lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally, we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in preserving coupling by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529), demonstrating the feasibility of this design.

Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data.

In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to perform slow thinking via in-context learning.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14489", "date_published": "2025-05-21T04:28:45"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13547", "image": "", "title": "Exploring Federated Pruning for Large Language Models", "content_text": "LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs, enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices.

To address this issue, we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework, including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to scale weights.

Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14677", "date_published": "2025-05-21T06:24:13"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14673", "image": "", "title": "Training-Free Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generation", "content_text": "Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent malicious misuse of visual generative models.

IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder.

Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce.

However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME.

To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks.

Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline, spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer.

NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models.

In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization.

We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14633", "date_published": "2025-05-21T17:15:19"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14629", "image": "", "title": "KERL: Knowledge-Enhanced Personalized Recipe Recommendation using Large\n  Language Models", "content_text": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis.

However, current approaches depend on complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved brain-to-image decoding.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14556", "date_published": "2025-05-21T13:58:19"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14366", "image": "", "title": "Towards Embodied Cognition in Robots via Spatially Grounded Synthetic\n  Worlds", "content_text": "We present a conceptual framework for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform Visual Perspective Taking (VPT), a core capability for embodied cognition essential for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

While existing methods rely on global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities, introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks. We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11563", "date_published": "2025-05-21T12:53:54"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06914", "image": "", "title": "The Distracting Effect: Understanding Irrelevant Passages in RAG", "content_text": "A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs.   Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting passages.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06914", "date_published": "2025-05-21T15:18:10"}]}
