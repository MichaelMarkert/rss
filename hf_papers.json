While progress has been made in addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary issues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific problem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big Seven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven distinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to guide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a progressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific stage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a Critic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking and stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the EMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that outperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the additional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as generalization ability.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16905", "date_published": "2025-03-24T02:21:41"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16874", "image": "", "title": "MARS: A Multi-Agent Framework Incorporating Socratic Guidance for\n  Automated Prompt Optimization", "content_text": "The basic question-answering format of large language models involves inputting a prompt and receiving a response, and the quality of the prompt directly impacts the effectiveness of the response. Automated Prompt Optimization (APO) aims to break free from the cognitive biases of manually designed prompts and explores a broader design space for prompts. However, existing APO methods suffer from limited flexibility of fixed templates and inefficient search in prompt spaces as key issues. To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent framework Incorporating Socratic guidance (MARS), which utilizes multi-agent fusion technology for automatic planning, with gradual continuous optimization and evaluation. Specifically, MARS comprises seven agents, each with distinct functionalities, which autonomously use the Planner to devise an optimization path that ensures flexibility. Additionally, it employs a Teacher-Critic-Student Socratic dialogue pattern to iteratively optimize the prompts while conducting effective search. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method, and perform additional analytical experiments to assess the model's advancement as well as the interpretability.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16874", "date_published": "2025-03-24T02:26:26"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16408", "image": "", "title": "RoboFactory: Exploring Embodied Agent Collaboration with Compositional\n  Constraints", "content_text": "Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning, aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16408", "date_published": "2025-03-24T03:05:09"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16430", "image": "", "title": "Bridging Continuous and Discrete Tokens for Autoregressive Visual\n  Generation", "content_text": "Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

Motivated by these findings, our study investigates whether similar reasoning capabilities can be successfully integrated into large vision-language models (LVLMs) and assesses their impact on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. We consider an approach that iteratively leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight training data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further improve model generalization. Initially, reasoning capabilities were distilled from pure-text R1 models by generating reasoning steps using high-quality captions of the images sourced from diverse visual datasets. Subsequently, iterative RL training further enhance reasoning skills, with each iteration's RL-improved model generating refined SFT datasets for the next round. This iterative process yielded OpenVLThinker, a LVLM exhibiting consistently improved reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for robust vision-language reasoning.

However, LLM post-training often focuses on improving generation quality but neglects to facilitate output diversity. Hence, in creative writing generation, we investigate post-training approaches to promote both output diversity and quality. Our core idea is to include deviation -- the degree of difference between a training sample and all other samples with the same prompt -- in the training objective to facilitate learning from rare high-quality instances. By adopting our approach to direct preference optimization (DPO) and odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), we demonstrate that we can promote the output diversity of trained models while minimally decreasing quality. Our best model with 8B parameters could achieve on-par diversity as a human-created dataset while having output quality similar to the best instruction-tuned models we examined, GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. We further validate our approaches with a human evaluation, an ablation, and a comparison to an existing diversification approach, DivPO.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17126", "date_published": "2025-03-24T02:09:24"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17287", "image": "", "title": "FastCuRL: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Progressive Context\n  Extension for Efficient Training R1-like Reasoning Models", "content_text": "In this paper, we propose \\textsc{FastCuRL}, a simple yet efficient Curriculum Reinforcement Learning approach with context window extending strategy to accelerate the reinforcement learning training efficiency for R1-like reasoning models while enhancing their performance in tackling complex reasoning tasks with long chain-of-thought rationales, particularly with a 1.5B parameter language model. \\textsc{FastCuRL} consists of two main procedures: length-aware training data segmentation and context window extension training. Specifically, the former first splits the original training data into three different levels by the input prompt length, and then the latter leverages segmented training datasets with a progressively increasing context window length to train the reasoning model. Experimental results demonstrate that \\textsc{FastCuRL}-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview across all five datasets (including MATH 500, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, Minerva Math, and OlympiadBench) while only utilizing 50\\% of training steps.

To address these limitations, we introduce VCtrl (also termed PP-VCtrl), a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over pre-trained video diffusion models in a unified manner. VCtrl integrates diverse user-specified control signals-such as Canny edges, segmentation masks, and human keypoints-into pretrained video diffusion models via a generalizable conditional module capable of uniformly encoding multiple types of auxiliary signals without modifying the underlying generator. Additionally, we design a unified control signal encoding pipeline and a sparse residual connection mechanism to efficiently incorporate control representations. Comprehensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that VCtrl effectively enhances controllability and generation quality.

This paper explores the critical role of preference data in the training process of diffusion models, particularly in the context of Diffusion-DPO and its subsequent adaptations. We investigate the complexities surrounding universal human preferences in image generation, highlighting the subjective nature of these preferences and the challenges posed by minority samples in preference datasets. Through pilot experiments, we demonstrate the existence of minority samples and their detrimental effects on model performance. We propose Adaptive-DPO -- a novel approach that incorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective. This metric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an Adaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing the model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of minority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively handles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the way for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16921", "date_published": "2025-03-24T01:54:41"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16549", "image": "", "title": "MathFlow: Enhancing the Perceptual Flow of MLLMs for Visual Mathematical\n  Problems", "content_text": "Despite impressive performance across diverse tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have yet to fully demonstrate their potential in visual mathematical problem-solving, particularly in accurately perceiving and interpreting diagrams. Inspired by typical processes of humans, we hypothesize that the perception capabilities to extract meaningful information from diagrams is crucial, as it directly impacts subsequent inference processes. To validate this hypothesis, we developed FlowVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes all information used during problem-solving into four components, which are then combined into six problem versions for evaluation. Our preliminary results on FlowVerse reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit substantial limitations when extracting essential information and reasoned property from diagrams and performing complex reasoning based on these visual inputs. In response, we introduce MathFlow, a modular problem-solving pipeline that decouples perception and inference into distinct stages, thereby optimizing each independently. Given the perceptual limitations observed in current MLLMs, we trained MathFlow-P-7B as a dedicated perception model. Experimental results indicate that MathFlow-P-7B yields substantial performance gains when integrated with various closed-source and open-source inference models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the MathFlow pipeline and its compatibility to diverse inference frameworks.

Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an Adaptive Data Refinement Framework (ADR), which consists of two stages: Data Rebalancing (DR) and Data Synthesis (DS). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12821", "date_published": "2025-03-24T04:28:13"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.11572", "image": "", "title": "Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models", "content_text": "Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research examining `implicit bias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon differently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model outputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we present a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) for studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ step-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that reasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. These findings suggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous to human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit bias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.11572", "date_published": "2025-03-24T03:45:38"}]}
