However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach makes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers, enhancing their potential for real-time applications.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.10389", "date_published": "2025-02-17T03:22:08"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09696", "image": "", "title": "ZeroBench: An Impossible Visual Benchmark for Contemporary Large Multimodal Models", "content_text": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit major shortfalls when interpreting images and, by some measures, have poorer spatial cognition than small children or animals. Despite this, they attain high scores on many popular visual benchmarks, with headroom rapidly eroded by an ongoing surge of model progress. To address this, there is a pressing need for difficult benchmarks that remain relevant for longer. We take this idea to its limit by introducing ZeroBench-a lightweight visual reasoning benchmark that is entirely impossible for contemporary frontier LMMs. Our benchmark consists of 100 manually curated questions and 334 less difficult subquestions. We evaluate 20 LMMs on ZeroBench, all of which score 0.0%, and rigorously analyse the errors. To encourage progress in visual understanding, we publicly release ZeroBench.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09696", "date_published": "2025-02-17T03:20:53"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.10391", "image": "", "title": "MM-RLHF: The Next Step Forward in Multimodal LLM Alignment", "content_text": "Despite notable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), most state-of-the-art models have not undergone thorough alignment with human preferences. This gap exists because current alignment research has primarily achieved progress in specific areas (e.g., hallucination reduction), while the broader question of whether aligning models with human preferences can systematically enhance MLLM capability remains largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce MM-RLHF, a dataset containing 120k fine-grained, human-annotated preference comparison pairs. This dataset represents a substantial advancement over existing resources, offering superior size, diversity, annotation granularity, and quality. Leveraging this dataset, we propose several key innovations to improve both the quality of reward models and the efficiency of alignment algorithms. Notably, we introduce a Critique-Based Reward Model, which generates critiques of model outputs before assigning scores, offering enhanced interpretability and more informative feedback compared to traditional scalar reward mechanisms. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Reward Scaling, a method that adjusts the loss weight of each sample according to the reward signal, thereby optimizing the use of high-quality comparison pairs. Our approach is rigorously evaluated across 10 distinct dimensions and 27 benchmarks, with results demonstrating significant and consistent improvements in model performance. Specifically, fine-tuning LLaVA-ov-7B with MM-RLHF and our alignment algorithm leads to a 19.5% increase in conversational abilities and a 60% improvement in safety.   We have open-sourced the preference dataset, reward model, training and evaluation code, as well as reward modeling and safety benchmarks.

A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models.

This fragmentation makes both training and inference less efficient and adversely affects the model's performance on number-related tasks. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained LLMs internally learn Fourier-like features for number tokens, we propose Fourier Number Embedding (FoNE), a novel method that directly maps numbers into the embedding space with their Fourier features. FoNE encodes each number as a single token with only two embedding dimensions per digit, effectively capturing numerical values without fragmentation. This compact representation accelerates both training and inference. Compared to traditional subword and digit-wise embeddings, FoNE not only reduces computational overhead but also achieves higher accuracy across various numerical tasks including addition, subtraction and multiplication. On 6-digit decimal addition, FoNE requires 64times less data to achieve 99% accuracy than subword and digit-wise embeddings while using 3times and 6times fewer tokens per number, respectively. Furthermore, FoNE is the only method that yields 100% accuracy on over 100,000 test examples for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.10177", "date_published": "2025-02-17T02:31:11"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09638", "image": "", "title": "Jailbreaking to Jailbreak", "content_text": "Refusal training on Large Language Models (LLMs) prevents harmful outputs, yet this defense remains vulnerable to both automated and human-crafted jailbreaks. We present a novel LLM-as-red-teamer approach in which a human jailbreaks a refusal-trained LLM to make it willing to jailbreak itself or other LLMs. We refer to the jailbroken LLMs as J_2 attackers, which can systematically evaluate target models using various red teaming strategies and improve its performance via in-context learning from the previous failures. Our experiments demonstrate that Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 1.5 pro outperform other LLMs as J_2, achieving 93.0% and 91.0% attack success rates (ASRs) respectively against GPT-4o (and similar results across other capable LLMs) on Harmbench. Our work not only introduces a scalable approach to strategic red teaming, drawing inspiration from human red teamers, but also highlights jailbreaking-to-jailbreak as an overlooked failure mode of the safeguard. Specifically, an LLM can bypass its own safeguards by employing a jailbroken version of itself that is willing to assist in further jailbreaking. To prevent any direct misuse with J_2, while advancing research in AI safety, we publicly share our methodology while keeping specific prompting details private.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09638", "date_published": "2025-02-17T05:04:19"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09992", "image": "", "title": "Large Language Diffusion Models", "content_text": "Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09992", "date_published": "2025-02-17T05:03:18"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.09955", "image": "", "title": "Diverse Inference and Verification for Advanced Reasoning", "content_text": "Reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 have made significant progress in mathematics and coding, yet find challenging advanced tasks such as International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) combinatorics problems, Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) puzzles, and Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) questions. We use a diverse inference approach that combines multiple models and methods at test time. We find that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective. We automatically verify correctness of solutions to IMO problems by Lean, and ARC puzzles by code, and find that best-of-N effectively answers HLE questions. Our approach increases answer accuracy on IMO combinatorics problems from 33.3% to 77.8%, accuracy on HLE questions from 8% to 37%, and solves 80% of ARC puzzles that 948 humans could not and 26.5% of ARC puzzles that o3 high compute does not.
