Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation.

Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling.

However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training.

Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process.

In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset.

We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement.

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems.
