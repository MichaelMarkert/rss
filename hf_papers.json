Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.01785", "date_published": "2026-02-04T02:45:44"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.01630", "image": "", "title": "Research on World Models Is Not Merely Injecting World Knowledge into Specific Tasks", "content_text": "Current world models lack unified frameworks despite task-specific advances, necessitating a comprehensive approach integrating interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models.

The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling.

However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors.

In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step.

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path.

Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies.

Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning.

AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries.

To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost.

We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-A multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents.

The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives.

In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation.
