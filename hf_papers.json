To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective temporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video sequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE, an test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling extrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long short-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19325", "date_published": "2025-03-26T02:07:14"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18931", "image": "", "title": "CoMP: Continual Multimodal Pre-training for Vision Foundation Models", "content_text": "Pre-trained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong visual representations for a wide range of applications.

To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models.

Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19903", "date_published": "2025-03-26T03:43:20"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14905", "image": "", "title": "Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection\n  with Artifact Explanation", "content_text": "With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection.

We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent.

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion.

We introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow and Score Matching, a generative framework on the simplex based on a novel Gumbel-Softmax interpolant with a time-dependent temperature. Using this interpolant, we introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching by deriving a parameterized velocity field that transports from smooth categorical distributions to distributions concentrated at a single vertex of the simplex. We alternatively present Gumbel-Softmax Score Matching which learns to regress the gradient of the probability density. Our framework enables high-quality, diverse generation and scales efficiently to higher-dimensional simplices. To enable training-free guidance, we propose Straight-Through Guided Flows (STGFlow), a classifier-based guidance method that leverages straight-through estimators to steer the unconditional velocity field toward optimal vertices of the simplex. STGFlow enables efficient inference-time guidance using classifiers pre-trained on clean sequences, and can be used with any discrete flow method. Together, these components form a robust framework for controllable de novo sequence generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in conditional DNA promoter design, sequence-only protein generation, and target-binding peptide design for rare disease treatment.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17361", "date_published": "2025-03-26T01:48:51"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.11849", "image": "", "title": "Towards a Unified Copernicus Foundation Model for Earth Vision", "content_text": "Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets.

They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19356", "date_published": "2025-03-26T14:17:21"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17982", "image": "", "title": "Co-SemDepth: Fast Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation on\n  Aerial Images", "content_text": "Understanding the geometric and semantic properties of the scene is crucial in autonomous navigation and particularly challenging in the case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. Such information may be by obtained by estimating depth and semantic segmentation maps of the surrounding environment and for their practical use in autonomous navigation, the procedure must be performed as close to real-time as possible. In this paper, we leverage monocular cameras on aerial robots to predict depth and semantic maps in low-altitude unstructured environments. We propose a joint deep-learning architecture that can perform the two tasks accurately and rapidly, and validate its effectiveness on MidAir and Aeroscapes benchmark datasets. Our joint-architecture proves to be competitive or superior to the other single and joint architecture methods while performing its task fast predicting 20.2 FPS on a single NVIDIA quadro p5000 GPU and it has a low memory footprint.
