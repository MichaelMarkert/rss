The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench.

In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.

The difficulty increases when aiming for finer control in the generation. To that end, prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction.

To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark.

Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven effective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other tasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and limitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight challenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, NP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional models (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g., o1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either independently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate lower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance improvements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model inference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages of inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity increases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate to higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple independent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that, for some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average performance of today's most advanced reasoning models. However, for other tasks, a significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling regimes.

Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively. Human evaluation confirms the high quality of generated questions, while ablation and convergence analyses validate the contribution of each component in SEA.

To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity.

Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation.

In this paper, we achieve strong chaptering performance on hour-long videos by efficiently addressing the problem in the text domain with our 'Chapter-Llama' framework. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained large language model (LLM) with large context window, and feed as input (i) speech transcripts and (ii) captions describing video frames, along with their respective timestamps. Given the inefficiency of exhaustively captioning all frames, we propose a lightweight speech-guided frame selection strategy based on speech transcript content, and experimentally demonstrate remarkable advantages. We train the LLM to output timestamps for the chapter boundaries, as well as free-form chapter titles. This simple yet powerful approach scales to processing one-hour long videos in a single forward pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements (e.g., 45.3 vs 26.7 F1 score) over the state of the art on the recent VidChapters-7M benchmark. To promote further research, we release our code and models at our project page.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00072", "date_published": "2025-04-02T05:32:28"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24210", "image": "", "title": "DiET-GS: Diffusion Prior and Event Stream-Assisted Motion Deblurring 3D\n  Gaussian Splatting", "content_text": "Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.
