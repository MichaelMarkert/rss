Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03724", "date_published": "2025-07-08T03:16:43"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.00994", "image": "", "title": "Should We Still Pretrain Encoders with Masked Language Modeling?", "content_text": "Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30 models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over 15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM generally yields better performance across text representation tasks, CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem), reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

However, the majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency, and improves overall reconstruction quality.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04447", "date_published": "2025-07-08T05:25:37"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05197", "image": "", "title": "Pre-Trained Policy Discriminators are General Reward Models", "content_text": "A scalable reward modeling method, Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), enhances reward model performance and generalizes robustly in reinforcement learning through policy comparison.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from 1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance. For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36% to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks.

All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths.

However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose RefineX, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens.

However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution.

To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03336", "date_published": "2025-07-08T04:17:33"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04285", "image": "", "title": "SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence", "content_text": "SeqTex leverages pretrained video foundation models to directly generate high-fidelity UV texture maps through a sequence generation approach, enhancing 3D texture generation with superior consistency and alignment.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world generalization.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04285", "date_published": "2025-07-08T10:16:17"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.02659", "image": "", "title": "OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device\n  Speculative Decoding", "content_text": "OmniDraft, a unified framework, addresses cross-vocabulary mismatch and improves decoding speed by allowing a single draft model to interact dynamically with diverse target models in online settings.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the ``one drafter for all'' paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.02659", "date_published": "2025-07-08T04:04:16"}]}
