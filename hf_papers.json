Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern.

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead.

Despite recent progress, existing approaches often rely on pretrained encoders, semantic distillation, or heterogeneous CNN-based architectures. These designs introduce fixed inductive biases that limit reconstruction fidelity and hinder effective scaling. In this paper, we argue that discrete audio tokenization should be learned fully end-to-end using a homogeneous and scalable architecture. To this end, we first propose CAT (Causal Audio Tokenizer with Transformer), a purely Transformer-based architecture that jointly optimizes the encoder, quantizer, and decoder from scratch for high-fidelity reconstruction. Building on the CAT architecture, we develop MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer, a large-scale audio tokenizer featuring 1.6 billion parameters, pre-trained on 3 million hours of diverse, general audio data. We show that this simple, fully end-to-end approach built from homogeneous, causal Transformer blocks scales gracefully and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse audio domains.

In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion.

Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks.

However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus.

Uniquely, we repurpose frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as continuous affective sensors, distilling high-dimensional visual streams into dense, narrative-aware Valence-Arousal trajectories.

While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a 16% improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail.

In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.
