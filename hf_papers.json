However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04625", "date_published": "2025-03-07T03:35:47"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04222", "image": "", "title": "FuseChat-3.0: Preference Optimization Meets Heterogeneous Model Fusion", "content_text": "We introduce FuseChat-3.0, a suite of large language models (LLMs) developed by integrating the strengths of heterogeneous source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. Our source models include the powerful Gemma-2-27B-it, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For target models, we focus on three widely-used smaller variants-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct-along with two ultra-compact options, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. To leverage the diverse capabilities of these source models, we develop a specialized data construction protocol tailored to various tasks and domains. The FuseChat-3.0 training pipeline consists of two key stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the target and source model distributions, and (2) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to apply preferences from multiple source LLMs to fine-tune the target model. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models exhibit significant performance gains across tasks such as instruction following, general knowledge, mathematics, and coding. As illustrated in Figure 1, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the target model, our fusion approach achieves an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable gains of 37.1 points and 30.1 points on the instruction-following benchmarks AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard, respectively.

However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub.   To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as a baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants.   Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 69% F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set of baseline approaches.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.02191", "date_published": "2025-03-07T05:11:25"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04598", "image": "", "title": "HybridNorm: Towards Stable and Efficient Transformer Training via Hybrid Normalization", "content_text": "Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose HybridNorm, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models. %Code will be made publicly available.

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04378", "date_published": "2025-03-07T03:10:18"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03983", "image": "", "title": "Audio Flamingo 2: An Audio-Language Model with Long-Audio Understanding and Expert Reasoning Abilities", "content_text": "Understanding and reasoning over non-speech sounds and music are crucial for both humans and AI agents to interact effectively with their environments. In this paper, we introduce Audio Flamingo 2 (AF2), an Audio-Language Model (ALM) with advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. AF2 leverages (i) a custom CLAP model, (ii) synthetic Audio QA data for fine-grained audio reasoning, and (iii) a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy. AF2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3B parameter small language model, surpassing large open-source and proprietary models across over 20 benchmarks. Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs to 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, a large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Fine-tuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities. We conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the efficacy of our approach.

Inspired by the \"broken telephone\" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.20258", "date_published": "2025-03-07T04:56:18"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04094", "image": "", "title": "Pok\u00e9Champ: an Expert-level Minimax Language Agent", "content_text": "We introduce Pok\\'eChamp, a minimax agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for Pok\\'emon battles. Built on a general framework for two-player competitive games, Pok\\'eChamp leverages the generalist capabilities of LLMs to enhance minimax tree search. Specifically, LLMs replace three key modules: (1) player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function estimation, enabling the agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and human knowledge to reduce the search space and address partial observability. Notably, our framework requires no additional LLM training. We evaluate Pok\\'eChamp in the popular Gen 9 OU format. When powered by GPT-4o, it achieves a win rate of 76% against the best existing LLM-based bot and 84% against the strongest rule-based bot, demonstrating its superior performance. Even with an open-source 8-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 model, Pok\\'eChamp consistently outperforms the previous best LLM-based bot, Pok\\'ellmon powered by GPT-4o, with a 64% win rate. Pok\\'eChamp attains a projected Elo of 1300-1500 on the Pok\\'emon Showdown online ladder, placing it among the top 30%-10% of human players. In addition, this work compiles the largest real-player Pok\\'emon battle dataset, featuring over 3 million games, including more than 500k high-Elo matches. Based on this dataset, we establish a series of battle benchmarks and puzzles to evaluate specific battling skills. We further provide key updates to the local game engine. We hope this work fosters further research that leverage Pok\\'emon battle as benchmark to integrate LLM technologies with game-theoretic algorithms addressing general multiagent problems.

However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5\\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames.

However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a sim14,000times compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Keling, and Hailuo.
