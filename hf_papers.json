Despite numerous efforts, no single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from Gemma-2-2b residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based interpretation. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content.

Inspired by the clustering patterns of hidden states and activations in LLMs, SEAP identifies task-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving task performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, at 50% pruning, SEAP surpasses both WandA and FLAP by over 20%, and at 20% pruning, it incurs only a 2.2% performance drop compared to the dense model.

MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort.

This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters.

Our framework is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce a lightweight <PRE_TAG>Condition Injection LoRA Module</POST_TAG>. This module processes conditional signals in isolation, acting as a plug-and-play solution.

We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities.

Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving.

To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1.

To mitigate this inefficiency, we introduce adapter guidance distillation (AGD), a novel approach that simulates CFG in a single forward pass. AGD leverages lightweight adapters to approximate CFG, effectively doubling the sampling speed while maintaining or even improving sample quality. Unlike prior guidance distillation methods that tune the entire model, AGD keeps the base model frozen and only trains minimal additional parameters (sim2%) to significantly reduce the resource requirement of the distillation phase. Additionally, this approach preserves the original model weights and enables the adapters to be seamlessly combined with other checkpoints derived from the same base model. We also address a key mismatch between training and inference in existing guidance distillation methods by training on CFG-guided trajectories instead of standard diffusion trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that AGD achieves comparable or superior FID to CFG across multiple architectures with only half the NFEs.

To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability.

We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.05641", "date_published": "2025-03-11T14:13:21"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03511", "image": "", "title": "NeuGrasp: Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction with Background\n  Priors for Material-Agnostic Object Grasp Detection", "content_text": "Robotic grasping in scenes with transparent and specular objects presents great challenges for methods relying on accurate depth information. In this paper, we introduce NeuGrasp, a neural surface reconstruction method that leverages background priors for material-agnostic grasp detection. NeuGrasp integrates transformers and global prior volumes to aggregate multi-view features with spatial encoding, enabling robust surface reconstruction in narrow and sparse viewing conditions. By focusing on foreground objects through residual feature enhancement and refining spatial perception with an occupancy-prior volume, NeuGrasp excels in handling objects with transparent and specular surfaces. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world scenarios show that NeuGrasp outperforms state-of-the-art methods in grasping while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality.

How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets and models, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall.
