An\n  Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers", "content_text": "A benchmark evaluates multimodal models' ability to interpret scientific schematic diagrams and answer related questions, revealing performance gaps and insights for improvement.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over 465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10787", "date_published": "2025-07-16T03:21:11"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09411", "image": "", "title": "LLMalMorph: On The Feasibility of Generating Variant Malware using\n  Large-Language-Models", "content_text": "A semi-automated framework uses Large Language Models to generate malware variants, demonstrating reduced detection rates and notable attack success against ML classifiers.  \t\t\t\t\tAI-generated summary \t\t\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development and automated code generation. Motivated by these advancements, this paper explores the feasibility of LLMs in modifying malware source code to generate variants. We introduce LLMalMorph, a semi-automated framework that leverages semantical and syntactical code comprehension by LLMs to generate new malware variants. LLMalMorph extracts function-level information from the malware source code and employs custom-engineered prompts coupled with strategically defined code transformations to guide the LLM in generating variants without resource-intensive fine-tuning. To evaluate LLMalMorph, we collected 10 diverse Windows malware samples of varying types, complexity and functionality and generated 618 variants. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the detection rates of antivirus engines of these malware variants to some extent while preserving malware functionalities. In addition, despite not optimizing against any Machine Learning (ML)-based malware detectors, several variants also achieved notable attack success rates against an ML-based malware classifier. We also discuss the limitations of current LLM capabilities in generating malware variants from source code and assess where this emerging technology stands in the broader context of malware variant generation.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09411", "date_published": "2025-07-16T03:24:43"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09075", "image": "", "title": "OpenCodeReasoning-II: A Simple Test Time Scaling Approach via\n  Self-Critique", "content_text": "Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique. However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale, high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.", "url": "https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09075", "date_published": "2025-07-16T05:01:02"}]}
