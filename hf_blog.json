Instead of verbose text, the model emits tiny Python snippets for intermediate steps, runs them in a secure sandbox, and folds the results back into its reasoning, reducing errors and output length.

If you've ever used Qwen, Claude, or any other AI chatbot, you've probably noticed something: it takes a while for the first word of the response to appear, and then words appear one-by-one on your screen with (hopefully) a regular and fast-paced frequency. That's because at the heart of it, all LLMs are just fancy next token predictors. An LLM first processes your entire prompt to produce one new token. Then it keeps adding tokens one by one, each time reading everything that came before, until it decides generation is over.
