Gradio is compliant with the MCP server protocol and powers thousands of MCP servers hosted on Hugging Face Spaces . The Gradio team is betting big on Gradio and Spaces being the best way to build and host AI-powered MCP servers. To that end, here are some of the big improvements we've added to Gradio MCP servers as of version 5.38.0 .

This represented a significant milestone, but it was just the beginning. In 6 months, 500,000 repositories holding 20 PB joined the move to Xet as the Hub outgrows Git LFS and transitions to a storage system that scales with the workloads of AI builders.
