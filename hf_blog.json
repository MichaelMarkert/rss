This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike. For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called \u201ctiles\u201d of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image.
