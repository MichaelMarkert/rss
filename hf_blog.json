What do we need to know to build with Open Responses? Client Requests to Open Responses Changes for Inference Clients and Providers Open Responses for Routing Tools Sub Agent Loops Next Steps Open Responses is a new and open inference standard. Initiated by OpenAI, built by the open source AI community, and backed by the Hugging Face ecosystem, Open Responses is based on the Responses API and is designed for the future of Agents. In this blog post, we\u2019ll look at how Open Responses works and why the open source community should use Open Responses. The era of the chatbot is long gone, and agents dominate inference workloads. Developers are shifting toward autonomous systems that reason, plan, and act over long-time horizons.
