In 2025, it is more feasible than ever to run truly competitive models on-device. dots.ocr , a 3B parameter OCR model from RedNote, surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro in OmniDocBench , making OCR a truly no compromises on-device use case. Running models on-device is certainly appealing to developers: no smuggling API keys, zero cost, and no network required. However, if we want these models to run on-device, we need to be mindful of the limited compute and power budgets.
