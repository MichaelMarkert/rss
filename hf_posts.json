I recently stumbled upon a medical domain-specific FACTS Grounding leaderboard on Hugging Face, and the approach to evaluating AI accuracy in medical contexts is quite impressive, so I thought I'd share. \ud83d\udcca What is FACTS Grounding? It's originally a benchmark developed by Google DeepMind that measures how well LLMs generate answers based solely on provided documents. What's cool about this medical-focused version is that it's designed to test even small open-source models. \ud83c\udfe5 Medical Domain Version Features 236 medical examples: Extracted from the original 860 examples Tests small models like Qwen 3 1.7B: Great for resource-constrained environments Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash for evaluation: Simplified to a single judge model \ud83d\udcc8 The Evaluation Method is Pretty Neat Grounding Score: Are all claims in the response supported by the provided document?
