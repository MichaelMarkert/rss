It\u2019s not the fastest because humans will need to use the models to get scores, but it\u2019s worth the wait. lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard - OpenVLM Leaderboard is great for getting scores on vision language models opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard - Ai2 are doing a great job on RewardBench and I hope they keep it up because reward models are the unsexy workhorse of the field. allenai/reward-bench - The GAIA leaderboard is great for evaluating agent applications. gaia-benchmark/leaderboard \ud83e\udd29 This seems like such a sustainable way of building for the long term, where rather than leaning on a single...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/596060753193040", "date_published": "2025-03-16T09:20:00.168525"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MJannik/453920098995289", "image": "", "title": "I've published an article showing five ways to use \ud83e\udea2 Langfuse with \ud83e\udd17 Hugging Face.", "content_text": "I've published an article showing five ways to use \ud83e\udea2 Langfuse with \ud83e\udd17 Hugging Face.
