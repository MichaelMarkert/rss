Much of a model\u2019s usefulness comes from post-training optimization methods. Here are the main optimization algorithms (both classic and new) in one place: 1. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) -> Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (1707.06347) Clips the probability ratio to prevent the new policy from diverging too far from the old one. It helps keep everything stable 2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) -> Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model (2305.18290) It's a non RL method, where an LM is an implicit reward model. It uses a simple loss to boost the preferred answer\u2019s probability over the less preferred one 3.

A few months ago it was just a wild idea I shared with @ bygimenez , now it's real. Dione (Beta) is here, the easiest way to discover and install open-source apps, especially AI ones. Think of it as the Steam of open source. Installing open-source tools is often a mess. Dione fixes that. Beautiful UI and workflow. Soon multi-platform, multilingual & fully open-source. Users can even write and share their own installation scripts.

Given a source PDF or URL, it extracts the content from it, then tasks Meta's Llama 3.3-70B with writing the podcast script, with a good prompt crafted by @ gabrielchua (\"two hosts, with lively discussion, fun notes, insightful question etc.\") Then it hands off the text-to-speech conversion to Kokoro-82M, and there you go, you have two hosts discussion any article. The generation is nearly instant, because: > Llama 3.3 70B is running at 1,000 tokens/seconds with Cerebras inference > The audio is generated in streaming mode by the tiny (yet powerful) Kokoro, generating voices faster than real-time. And the audio generation runs for free on Zero GPUs, hosted by HF on H200s. Overall, open source solutions rival the quality of closed-source solutions at close to no cost!
