I am deeply concerned about AI model safety right now because, as the community rushes to roll out increasingly powerful open-source models, we are completely neglecting the most critical aspect: safety. It seems that nobody is seriously thinking about the potential consequences of unregulated model outputs or the necessity of robust guardrails. We are essentially planting the seeds for our own destruction if we prioritize raw performance over security. This negligence is terrifyingly evident when you look at the current landscape. Take Qwen Image 2512, for example; while it delivers undeniably strong performance, it has incredibly weak guardrails that make it dangerous to deploy. In stark contrast, Z Image might not get as much hype for its power, but it has much better safety guardrails than Qwen Image 2512.
