In our recent article, we discussed Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in detail and now it's time to summarize other existing types of attention. Here is a list of 15 types of attention mechanisms used in AI models: 1. Soft attention (Deterministic attention) -> Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (1409.0473) Assigns a continuous weight distribution over all parts of the input. It produces a weighted sum of the input using attention weights that sum to 1. 2. Hard attention (Stochastic attention) -> Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (1508.04025) Makes a discrete selection of some part of the input to focus on at each step, rather than attending to everything. 3. Self-attention -> Attention Is All You Need (1706.03762) Each element in the sequence \"looks\" at other elements and...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/624548696865407", "date_published": "2025-03-18T05:21:22.744861"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/443122762320210", "image": "", "title": "\u2702\ufe0f Gemma 3 Abliterated", "content_text": "\u2702\ufe0f Gemma 3 Abliterated I noticed that Gemma 3 was much more resilient to refusal removal than other models like Qwen 2.5.
