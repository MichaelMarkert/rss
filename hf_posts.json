For papers that include code, setting up the right environment often means hours of dependency hell and configuration debugging. At Remyx AI, we built an agent that automatically creates and tests Docker images for research papers, then shares them publicly so anyone can reproduce results with a single command. We just submitted PR #908 to integrate this directly into arXiv Labs.

When you ask a question with positive framing, you get positive answers. Ask with negative framing, you get negative answers. The AI becomes a mirror of your own assumptions. Your framing determines the answer - The same topic yields opposite responses based on how you ask AIs amplify your sentiment - Negative questions often get even MORE negative responses This affects everyone - From students doing research to professionals making decisions Why This Matters This isn't a technical glitch - it's fundamental to how these systems work. They're trained on human language, and humans frame things with bias. The AI learned to match that framing.

I uploaded a single photo of my corgi, and within minutes, it generated a detailed 3D figurine model. What makes this really interesting for tech and design folks: AI-powered 2D \u2192 3D conversion (no manual modeling required) Preserves character consistency even with multiple images Export options for 3D printing or digital use (OBJ, FBX, STL) Works with pets, people, and even illustrated characters For anyone into 3D modeling, collectibles, or architecture visualization, this is a game-changer. Imagine transforming static photos into tangible 3D assets with just a few clicks.
