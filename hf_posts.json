In this tutorial, I reveal the ultimate, one-click solution to creating stunning, photorealistic, and stylized AI art LOCALLY on your own computer\u2014for FREE. Tired of confusing workflows, endless command lines, and expensive subscriptions? Forget everything you know about Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI's complexity. I'm introducing you to SwarmUI, the revolutionary tool that leverages the power of ComfyUI's backend with an incredibly simple, user-friendly interface. This isn't just another AI tutorial. This is a complete, all-in-one guide that takes you from ZERO to AI Art PRO in minutes. I provide a one-click installer that sets up everything you need, including pre-configured presets for achieving breathtaking realism and incredible stylization. \ud83d\udd25 In This Video, You Will Discover: The Easiest AI Art Install Ever: A step-by-...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/932213585157202", "date_published": "2025-10-19T09:20:58.044659"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/611899757397292", "image": "", "title": "I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal", "content_text": "I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal embedding model, ranked first on the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark \ud83c\udf89 This model is the product of quite literally months of painstaking work alongside @ abdurrahmanbutler collecting, cleaning, and processing terabytes of data as well as coming up with novel improvements to the standard embedder training recipe to push the limits of what's possible. Kanon 2 Embedder is my most advanced model to date. On MLEB, it benchmarks as 9% more accurate than OpenAI's best embedding model and 30% faster. Even when truncated from 1,792 to 768 dimensions, Kanon 2 Embedder continues to hold the number one spot on MLEB. Importantly, Kanon 2 Embedder is also privacy and security friendly \u2014 unlike Voyage, Cohere and Jina, none of your data is used to train our models by default. Kanon 2 Embedder can also be self-hosted for enterprises with heightened security or reliability requirements.
