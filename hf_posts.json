Every language carries its own cultural values and worldviews. So, when we build AI systems, we're not just deciding how they speak but also whose perspectives they represent. Even choosing which dialect to train on in Norway becomes a question of inclusion and power. In Kenya, will AI speak Swahili from Nairobi or coastal regions? What about indigenous languages with rich oral traditions but limited written text, like Quechua in Peru or Cherokee in North America? The path forward? Building WITH communities, not just FOR them. Working with local partners (libraries, universities, civil society), testing for cultural alignment, and asking hard questions about representation. Just published some thoughts on this after my keynote in Norway a few weeks ago: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/when-ai-speaks See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/887797954746272", "date_published": "2025-06-21T17:19:26.246052"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/multimodalart/420236527922092", "image": "", "title": "Self-Forcing - a real-time video distilled model from Wan 2.1 by", "content_text": "Self-Forcing - a real-time video distilled model from Wan 2.1 by @ adobe is out, and they open sourced it \ud83d\udc10 I've built a live real time demo on Spaces \ud83d\udcf9\ud83d\udca8 multimodalart/self-forcing See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/multimodalart/420236527922092", "date_published": "2025-06-21T17:19:26.246284"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/605499380772806", "image": "", "title": "Introducing Windows Sandbox support - run computer-use agents on Windows business apps without VMs or cloud costs.", "content_text": "Introducing Windows Sandbox support - run computer-use agents on Windows business apps without VMs or cloud costs. Your enterprise software runs on Windows, but testing agents required expensive cloud instances. Windows Sandbox changes this - it's Microsoft's built-in lightweight virtualization sitting on every Windows 10/11 machine, ready for instant agent development. Enterprise customers kept asking for AutoCAD automation, SAP integration, and legacy Windows software support. Traditional VM testing was slow and resource-heavy. Windows Sandbox solves this with disposable, seconds-to-boot Windows environments for safe agent testing. What you can build: AutoCAD drawing automation, SAP workflow processing, Bloomberg terminal trading bots, manufacturing execution system integration, or any Windows-only enterprise software automation - all tested safely in disposable sandbox environments. Free with Windows 10/11, boots in seconds, completely disposable.
