Today, they are hallucinating beautifully. 10 years ago, getting an LSTM to output coherent English was a struggle. 10 years later, after a \"cure\" based on FineWeb-EDU and a custom synthetic mix for causal conversation, the results are fascinating. We trained this on ~10B tokens on a single AMD GPU (ROCm). It is not a Transformer: Echo-DSRN (400M) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by Hymba, RWKV, and xLSTM, designed to challenge the \"Attention is All You Need\" monopoly on the Edge. The ambitious goal is to build a small instruct model with RAG and tool usage capabilities ( ethicalabs/Kurtis-EON1 ) \ud83d\udcca The Benchmarks (Size: 400M) For a model this size (trained on <10B tokens), the specialized performance is surprising: *SciQ*: 73.8% \ud83e\udd84 (This rivals billion-parameter models in pure fact retrieval). *PIQA*: 62.3% (Solid physical intuition for a sub-1B model).

Sandford (1857) with Kanon 2 Enricher in less than ten seconds at the cost of 47 cents. Dred Scott v. Sandford is the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision by far, and has variously been called \"the worst Supreme Court decision ever\" and \"the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound\" due to its denial of the rights of African Americans. Thanks to Kanon 2 Enricher, we now also know that the case contains 950 numbered paragraphs, 6 footnotes, 178 people mentioned 1,340 times, 99 locations mentioned 1,294 times, and 298 external documents referenced 940 times.
