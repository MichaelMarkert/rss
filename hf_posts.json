Original jokes are particularly hard for LLMs, as jokes are very nuanced and a lot of context is needed to understand if something is \"funny\". Something that can only reliably be measured using humans. LLMs are not equally good at generating jokes in every language. Generated English jokes turned out to be way funnier than the Japanese ones. 46% of English-speaking voters on average found the generated joke funny. The same statistic for other languages: Vietnamese: 44% Portuguese: 40% Arabic: 37% Japanese: 28% There is not much variance in generation quality among models for any fixed language. But still Claude Sonnet 4 slightly outperforms others in Vietnamese, Arabic and Japanese and Gemini 2.5 Flash in Portuguese and English We have release the 1 Million (!) native speaker ratings and the 10'000 jokes...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/847126227827487", "date_published": "2025-07-16T05:30:00.116761"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Severian/232302079144255", "image": "", "title": "I couldn't watch innocent people get their rights trampled anymore.

Stories of families torn apart, U.S. citizens detained for hours, people arrested just for speaking Spanish. This isn't the America I believe in. Instead of doom-scrolling, I spent a few days building FIREWATCH - a free civil rights protection app. What it does: \u2022 Real-time ICE raid alerts \u2022 Know Your Rights education in 10+ languages \u2022 Secure evidence recording \u2022 Emergency panic button \u2022 Legal hotlines and resources \u2022 100% private, no tracking The catch? There isn't one. You just need a free Google API key that stays on your device. Works completely offline. https://firewatch-ice.vercel.app/ I built this because everyone deserves constitutional protection. The 4th Amendment doesn't have an asterisk. If this helps one family stay safe, every sleepless night was worth it. Please share with anyone who needs it. Stay safe.

VRAM usages and speeds are same but just better quality and animation. Moreover I am introducing a new app which is image and video comparison sliders. Ultra fast and lightweight.

It doesn't update the full model, it adds small trainable components, low-rank matrices, while keeping the original weights frozen. Only these adapters are trained. Recently, many interesting new LoRA variations came out, so it\u2019s a great time to take a look at these 13 clever approaches: 1. T-LoRA \u2192 T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting (2507.05964) A timestep-dependent LoRA method for adapting diffusion models with a single image. It dynamically adjusts updates and uses orthogonal initialization to reduce overlap, achieving better fidelity\u2013alignment balance than standard LoRA 2. SingLoRA \u2192 SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix (2507.05566) Simplifies LoRA by using only one small matrix instead of usual two, and multiplying it by its own transpose (like A \u00d7 A\u1d40).
