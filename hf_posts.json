Reliably de-anonymizing the response is the other.", "content_text": "Anonymizing a prompt is half the battle. Reliably de-anonymizing the response is the other. To build a truly reliable privacy pipeline, you have to test it. A new Master's thesis does just that, and our data was there for every step. We're excited to showcase this work on handling confidential data in LLM prompts from Nedim Karavdic at M\u00e4lardalen University. To build their PII anonymization pipeline, they first trained a custom NER model. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset was used as the foundational training data for this critical first step. But it didn't stop there. The research also used our dataset to create the parallel data needed to train and test the generative \"Seek\" models for de-anonymization. It's a win-win when our open-source data not only helps build the proposed \"better solution\" but also helps prove why it's better by enabling a rigorous, data-driven comparison. \ud83d\udd17 Check out the full thesis for a great deep-dive into building a practical, end-...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/647817712633860", "date_published": "2026-01-01T17:24:18.104604"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049", "image": "", "title": "As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out", "content_text": "As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out Reubencf/Nano_Banana_Editor looking forward to build and release more in the future for the open source community See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049", "date_published": "2026-01-01T17:24:18.104841"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/projectlosangeles/197104277785831", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\udd25Project Los Angeles is proud to announce the release of midisim \ud83d\udd25", "content_text": "\ud83d\udd25Project Los Angeles is proud to announce the release of midisim \ud83d\udd25 midisim is a SOTA Python package for calculating, searching and analyzing MIDI-to-MIDI similarity at speed and scale! projectlosangeles/midisim projectlosangeles/midisim-embeddings projectlosangeles/midisim-samples If you like midisim, please \u2764\ufe0f Project Los Angeles Tegridy Code 2025 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/projectlosangeles/197104277785831", "date_published": "2026-01-01T17:24:18.105120"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/di-zhang-fdu/784326148954716", "image": "", "title": "EZTinker: A easy tinker-style RL-as-a-service demo", "content_text": "EZTinker: A easy tinker-style RL-as-a-service demo https://github.com/trotsky1997/EZTinker See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/di-zhang-fdu/784326148954716", "date_published": "2026-01-01T17:24:18.105324"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/142145591956765", "image": "", "title": "Git is powerful, but it\u2019s also one of the biggest sources of developer mistakes.", "content_text": "Git is powerful, but it\u2019s also one of the biggest sources of developer mistakes. What is Git GUI, and how does it help here ? Git GUI makes version control visual, predictable, and easier to reason about especially when things go wrong. That\u2019s exactly why we built Git GUI in Voiden. Instead of relying on memorized commands, Voiden lets you see what Git is doing before it does it. What Voiden\u2019s Git GUI helps developers do \u2022 View exact file and line-level changes before committing \u2022 Stage only intended changes (no accidental commits) \u2022 Clearly distinguish staged vs unstaged files \u2022 Inspect visual diffs with full context \u2022 Understand branches, commit history, and repo state instantly When Git behavior is hidden, errors increase. Voiden\u2019s Git GUI doesn\u2019t abstract Git away, it explains Git. Whether you\u2019re new to Git or an experienced developer who prefers clarity, this is Git you can reason about. Version control should feel safe, not stressful.

In this tutorial I will show you how to use our 40+ amazing generative AI presets made for SwarmUI in ComfyUI with most easy way. You will be able to get very best outcomes of all AI models such as SDXL, FLUX, Z Image Turbo, Wan 2.1, Wan 2.2, FLUX 2, Qwen Image, Qwen Image Edit, FLUX Kontext, Image Outpainting, Image Inpainting and many more. Moreover, I will show how to use custom model paths in ComfyUI and SwarmUI to unify your models in same folder and avoid model duplication and save massive amount of disk space.
