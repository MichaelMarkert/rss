With the rapid advancement of AI agent technology, two architectures have come into the spotlight: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and MCO (Model Context Open-json). Today, we\u2019ll introduce the key features and differences of these two approaches. VIDraft/Agentic-AI-CHAT MCP: The Traditional Approach \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Centralized Function Registry: All functions are hardcoded into the core system. Static Function Definitions & Tight Coupling: New features require changes to the core application code, limiting scalability. Monolithic Design: Complex deployment and version management can cause a single error to affect the whole system. Code Example: '''py FUNCTION_REGISTRY = { \"existing_function\": existing_function, \"new_function\": new_function # Adding a new function } ''' MCO: A Revolutionary Approach \ud83c\udd95 JSON-based Function Definitions: Function details are stored in external JSON files, enabling dynamic module loading.

Good news: code LMs have gotten pretty good at automatic review, so we can offload some of the work - here I'm using Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct to generate reports and it works pretty OK \ud83d\ude4c The app works in three stages: 1. Download all code files 2. Use the Code LM to generate a detailed report pointing to code where data is transferred/(AI-)processed (screen 1) 3.
