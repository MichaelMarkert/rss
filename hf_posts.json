Instead of viewing an AI agent as a monolithic process, we\u2019ve decomposed it into four core tools that separate decision-making from execution \u2014 a design that\u2019s proving critical for scale and observability: \ud83e\udde9 MemoryTool \u2013 maintains persistent context and user continuity \u2705 CompletionTool \u2013 determines when a task is truly complete \ud83d\udcac UserInteractionTool \u2013 manages clarifications, approvals, and confirmations \ud83d\udd01 DelegationTool \u2013 enables agents to hand off tasks to other agents or humans This approach makes every step of an agent\u2019s workflow explicit, testable, and auditable, allowing us to scale AI systems in production with higher confidence. We see this as a step toward a more open, composable agent ecosystem \u2014 one where frameworks can interoperate and agents can...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/TravisMuhlestein/389636099872687", "date_published": "2025-11-13T05:25:04.599951"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/257570757344007", "image": "", "title": "SparkEmbedding - SoTA cross lingual retrieval", "content_text": "SparkEmbedding - SoTA cross lingual retrieval Iam very happy to announce our latest embedding model sparkembedding-300m base on embeddinggemma-300m we fine tuned it on 1m extra examples spanning over 119 languages and result is this model achieves exceptional cross lingual retrieval Model: XenArcAI/SparkEmbedding-300m See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/257570757344007", "date_published": "2025-11-13T05:25:04.600196"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/780653085928819", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 AutoXLA - Accelerating Large Models on TPU", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 AutoXLA - Accelerating Large Models on TPU AutoXLA is an experimental library that automates the distribution, optimization, and quantization of large language models for TPUs using PyTorch/XLA. It extends the Hugging Face Transformers interface with TPU-aware features such as automatic sharding, custom attention kernels, and quantization-aware loading, making large-scale deployment and training both simpler and faster. With quantization and Splash Attention kernels, AutoXLA achieves up to 4\u00d7 speedups over standard Flash Attention implementations, significantly improving throughput for both inference and training workloads. Whether you\u2019re experimenting with distributed setups (FSDP, 2D, or 3D sharding) or optimizing memory via LanguageModelQuantizer, AutoXLA is built to make scaling LLMs on TPU seamless. \u26a0\ufe0f Note: This is an experimental repository.
