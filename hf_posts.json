FLUX Text Imaginator is an innovative tool that leverages cutting-edge FLUX diffusion models to create and edit images with perfectly integrated multilingual text. Unlike other image generation models, FLUX possesses exceptional capability to naturally incorporate text in various languages including Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, French, Spanish and more into images! \u2728 FLUX's Multilingual Text Processing Strengths \ud83d\udd24 Superior Multilingual Text Rendering: FLUX renders text with amazing accuracy, including non-English languages and special characters \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 Perfect Korean Language Support: Accurately represents complex Korean combined characters \ud83c\ude36 Excellent East Asian Language Handling: Naturally expresses complex Chinese characters and Japanese text \ud83d\udd0d Sophisticated Text Placement: Precise text positioning using <text1>, <text2>,...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/804980229974999", "date_published": "2025-03-22T09:21:25.806274"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/clem/968928866217294", "image": "", "title": "Should we assemble affordable open-source robots at Hugging Face for the community.

We've worked to integrate the three frameworks in distinctive ways so that learners can reflect on when and where to use each. This also means that you can follow the course if you're already familiar with one of these frameworks, and soak up some of the fundamental knowledge in earlier units.

The main one is that we have designed a CUDA kernel to expand the Flash Attention by @ tridao with RPE biases and supports other PE such as RoPE, ALiBi or FIRE. The result kernel is 2 times faster than a SPDA implementation. We also use Triton kernels to optimize certain parts of the architecture, such as the cross-entropy and RMSNorm layer. The various kernels have been carefully built to be compatible with BF16 and torch.compile to go even faster and achieve efficient pretraining. All other optimizations are described in a \ud83d\udcdd subsequent blog post available on @ huggingface \ud83e\udd17: CATIE-AQ/FAT5-report .

It is not the worst model according to AHA leaderboard and it is one of the smart according to lmarena.ai. My objective is to make it based, anti woke, wise, beneficial and then some. Several GPUs are fine tuning it at the same time, each using a different dataset and using QLoRA and the successful ones are merged later. Compared to LoRa this allows faster training and also reduced overfitting because the merge operation heals overfitting. The problem with this could be the 4 bit quantization may make models dumber. But I am not looking for sheer IQ. Too much mind is a problem anyway :) Has anyone tried parallel QLoRa and merge before? I also automated the dataset selection and benchmarking and converging to objectives (the fit function, the reward).
