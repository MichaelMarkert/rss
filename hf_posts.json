Is that ethical or not? They could certainly do a better job by working with teams like llama.cpp, just like Qwen team did with Qwen 3 before releasing the model. In 2024 I started playing with LLMs just before the release of Llama 3. I think Meta contributed a lot to this field and still contributing. Most LLM fine tuning tools are based on their models and also the inference tool llama.cpp has their name on it. The Llama 4 is fast and maybe not the greatest in real performance but still deserves respect. But my enthusiasm towards Llama models is probably because they rank highest on my AHA Leaderboard: https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/open/mz41j09cc640a29ba47729fed784a263c1d08 Looks like they did a worse job compared to Llama 3.1 this time.

Ai2 just released OLMoTrace and it's a game-changer for transparency. You can literally see where an AI's responses come from in its training data - in real time. The demo shows results about C\u00e9line. So I tried it out myself! Watch what happens in the video. For journalists, researchers studying hallucinations and anyone who needs to trust their AI, this is like getting X-ray vision into AI systems. When the model made claims, I could instantly verify them against original sources. When it hallucinated, I could see why. You can finally 1) understand how LLMs actually work and 2) verify if what they're saying is true. No more blind trust. This pushes the open data movement to the next level. \ud83d\udc49 Blog post: https://allenai.org/blog/olmotrace \ud83d\udc49 Paper: https://www.datocms-assets.com/64837/1743890415-olmotrace.pdf P.S.: A word of caution: never use a chatbot as a knowledge base.
