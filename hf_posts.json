The most notable regression vs the base model here is in arithmetic - if your workload is math heavy this model demonstrates an unfortunate collapse with performance under growing complexity. The interesting combination of awesome overall performance on SVG simple shapes identification coupled with a total inability to recognize more complex shapes like 'House' or 'Arrow' is a behavior directly inherited from the base model (but with a ~20% improvement in token utilization). If you like your reasoning models token-efficient, Aquif-3.5-8B-Think is well worth a spin.
