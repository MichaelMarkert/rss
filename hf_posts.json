Comparing \"pass@1 averaged 10 times\" to \"normal pass@1\" is like grading one student by allowing them to take the test 10 times and averaging question scores, when the other students only get one chance at grading. The first way to grade (avg@10) is actually quite good statistically, much better than what model creators usually report, because models tend to be quite inconsistent - sometimes good, sometimes bad... But! You want to do it for all models then, and report with error bars. The issue is that, if you do... well, it's going to be harder to say your model is the best, because the error bars will overlap between models, by a lot....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/clefourrier/447221869970447", "date_published": "2025-05-25T05:21:59.295847"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/111888750511212", "image": "", "title": "Uggghhh what a busy week.", "content_text": "Uggghhh what a busy week.
