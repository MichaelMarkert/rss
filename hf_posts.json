Knowledge needs to be constantly refreshed and updated with the latest trends. So today, we\u2019re sharing 6 free sources to help you stay on track with RL: 1. A Survey of Continual Reinforcement Learning \u2192 https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21872 Covers continual RL (CRL): how agents can keep learning and adapt to new tasks without forgetting past ones. It analyses methods, benchmarks, evaluation metrics &challenges 2. The Deep Reinforcement Learning course by Hugging Face \u2192 https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction This is a popular free course, regularly updated. Includes community interaction, exercises, leaderboards, etc. 3.
