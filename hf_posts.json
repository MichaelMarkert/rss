Integrity violations\u2014like subtle data poisoning attacks\u2014can quietly erode your model\u2019s reliability, long before anyone notices. These attacks can be surprisingly effective with minimal changes to the dataset. At Duality, our work in high-stakes sectors like defense has driven us to tackle this threat head-on. In our latest blog from Duality's Director of Infrastructure and Security at Duality, David Strout, we unpack how data poisoning works, why it\u2019s so dangerous, and how organizations can secure their AI pipelines with clear provenance, regular performance auditing, and a trusted synthetic data supply chain.
