They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.

Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314", "date_published": "2025-12-25T13:35:11.829964"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/476967281276279", "image": "", "title": "Time-Effective LLM Querying in Information Retrieval Tasks", "content_text": "Time-Effective LLM Querying in Information Retrieval Tasks \ud83c\udfa4 Last week at Research Colloquium in Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, we presented a framework for time-effective data handling with prompting schemas.

A recurring lesson from production AI deployments is that most failures are system failures, not model failures. As organizations move beyond pilots, challenges increasingly shift toward: \u2022 Agent identity and permissioning \u2022 Trust boundaries between agents and human operators \u2022 Governance and auditability for autonomous actions \u2022 Security treated as a first-class architectural constraint This recent Fortune article highlights how enterprises are navigating that transition, including work with AWS\u2019s AI Innovation Lab.
