In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. \ud83d\udce4 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as <|user|> are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is <|endoftext|><|user|>. \ud83d\udccf Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752", "date_published": "2025-11-15T09:22:13.454707"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729", "image": "", "title": "Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! \ud83c\udf89", "content_text": "Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! \ud83c\udf89 Follow me for more @ ronantakizawa See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729", "date_published": "2025-11-15T09:22:13.454951"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/evalstate/865812476358807", "image": "", "title": "Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45", "content_text": "Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New!
