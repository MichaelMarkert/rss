This book presents alternatives that rely on explainable AI, featuring new algorithms based on radically different technology with trustworthy, auditable, fast, accurate, secure, replicable Enterprise AI. Most of the material is proprietary and made from scratch, showcasing the culmination of decades of research away from standard models to establish a new framework in machine learning and AI technology.

That's why we're highlighting the Priv-IQ benchmark, a new, solution-oriented framework for evaluating LLMs on eight key privacy competencies, from visual privacy to knowledge of privacy law. The direct connection to our work is clear: the researchers relied on samples from the Ai4Privacy dataset to build out questions for Privacy Risk Assessment and Multilingual Entity Recognition. This is the power of open-source collaboration. We provide the data building blocks, and researchers construct powerful new evaluation tools on top of them. It's a win-win for the entire ecosystem when we can all benefit from transparent, data-driven benchmarks that help push for better, safer AI. Kudos to Sakib Shahriar and Rozita A.

We send a prompt, get a \"meh\" answer, and then spend twenty minutes fixing it ourselves. That\u2019s not a workflow; that\u2019s just a digital chore. I wanted to see if I could push Claude further\u2014to see if I could build a system that actually learns and refines itself. That\u2019s how the Claude-Reflect-System (Skill Reflect) was born. But here\u2019s the thing: this isn\u2019t some polished, final product. It\u2019s a concept. It\u2019s a blueprint. I\u2019ve built the foundation of a recursive reflection loop that forces the AI to step back, look at its work, and act as its own harshest critic. It identifies the \"skill delta\"\u2014the gap between \"okay\" and \"mastery\"\u2014and closes it. This logic isn't just for Claude; you can grab this architecture and drop it right into codex-cli, terminal agents, or whatever stack you're building. I\u2019m a big believer in the law of causality.
