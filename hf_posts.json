Some of its directions are already showing huge promise, while others are still early but exciting. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s happening right now in RL: 1. Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) \u2192 Reinforcement Pre-Training (2506.08007) Reframes next-token pretraining as RL with verifiable rewards, yielding scalable reasoning gains 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2192 Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences (1706.03741) The top approach. It trains a model using human preference feedback, building a reward model and then optimizing the policy to generate outputs people prefer 3. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) \u2192 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs (2506.14245) Moves from subjective (human-labeled) rewards to objective ones that can be automatically verified, like in...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/610901061800000", "date_published": "2025-10-06T17:20:17.865912"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/329376915558167", "image": "", "title": "Ovi - Generate Videos With Audio Like VEO 3 or SORA 2 - Run Locally - Open Source for Free", "content_text": "Ovi - Generate Videos With Audio Like VEO 3 or SORA 2 - Run Locally - Open Source for Free Download and install : https://www.patreon.com/posts/140393220 Quick demo tutorial : https://youtu.be/uE0QabiHmRw Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation Project page : https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi/ SECourses Ovi Pro Premium App Features Full scale ultra advanced app for Ovi - an open source project that can generate videos from both text prompts and image + text prompts with real audio.

My co-author @ cgeorgiaw and I just published a paper challenging a core assumption: that the main barriers to AI in science are technical. They're not. They're social. Key findings: \ud83d\udea8 The \"AI Scientist\" myth delays progress: Waiting for AGI devalues human expertise and obscures science's real purpose: cultivating understanding, not just outputs. \ud83d\udcca Wrong incentives: Datasets have 100x longer impact than models, yet data curation is undervalued. \u26a0\ufe0f Broken collaboration: Domain scientists want understanding. ML researchers optimize performance. Without shared language, projects fail. \ud83d\udd0d Fragmentation costs years: Harmonizing just 9 cancer files took 329 hours. Why this matters: Upstream bottlenecks like efficient PDE solvers could accelerate discovery across multiple sciences. CASP mobilized a community around protein structure, enabling AlphaFold.
