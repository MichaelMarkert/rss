This work was part of a paper we published to ICCR Kyoto 2025. Check out or code here: https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot/tree/main Our work aims to solve two key problems in the world of robotic manipulation: 1. The lack of a well-developed, open-source, accessible teleoperation system that can work out of the box. 2. No performant end-to-end control, recording, and learning platform for robots that is completely hardware agnostic.

We built hundreds of Docker images for arXiv papers with a codebase - it's tough to find what you're looking for unless you happen to have the arXiv id handy using DockerHub's search. So we added full text search over these resources so that you're that much closer to testing a new promising idea. More resources to be indexed soon!
