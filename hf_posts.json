I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation\u2014on just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt\u2013response pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn\u2019t turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands \u201cOh great, another meeting\u201d exactly as you mean it.

It's smarter, faster, and now understands 119 languages instead of just 29. It can do both deep reasoning and quick answers using a single model, depending on what you need. The models range in size from small (0.6B) to huge (235B), with smart ways to save compute. It's trained on 36 trillion tokens and fine-tuned in four steps to boost performance. Qwen3 performs as well as or better than many top models, including some from big companies. It\u2019s fully open-source under licence.

The model is built based on SigLIP2-400M and MiniCPM4-3B, with a total of 4.1B parameters. It inherits the strong single-image, multi-image, and video understanding performance of MiniCPM-V 2.6 with largely improved efficiency. \u2728 With only 4.1B parameters, MiniCPM-V 4.0 achieves an average score of 69.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. This performance surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414, MiniCPM-V 2.6 (8.1B parameters, OpenCompass 65.2), and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3.8B parameters, OpenCompass 64.5). It also shows good performance in multi-image and video understanding.
