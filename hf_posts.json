Comparing \"pass@1 averaged 10 times\" to \"normal pass@1\" is like grading one student by allowing them to take the test 10 times and averaging question scores, when the other students only get one chance at grading. The first way to grade (avg@10) is actually quite good statistically, much better than what model creators usually report, because models tend to be quite inconsistent - sometimes good, sometimes bad... But! You want to do it for all models then, and report with error bars. The issue is that, if you do... well, it's going to be harder to say your model is the best, because the error bars will overlap between models, by a lot....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/clefourrier/447221869970447", "date_published": "2025-05-25T17:18:09.490367"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/971729248373235", "image": "", "title": "Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers & benchmarks! \ud83d\udd25 with 60+ \u2b50\ufe0f now!", "content_text": "Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers & benchmarks! \ud83d\udd25 with 60+ \u2b50\ufe0f now!

It differs from transformers by predicting the representation of a missing or future part of the input, rather than the next token or pixel. This encourages conceptual understanding, not just low-level pattern matching. So JEPA allows teaching AI to reason abstractly. Here are 12 types of JEPA you should know about: 1. I-JEPA -> Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (2301.08243) A non-generative, self-supervised learning framework designed for processing images. It works by masking parts of the images and then trying to predict those masked parts 2. MC-JEPA -> MC-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Self-Supervised Learning of Motion and Content Features (2307.12698) Simultaneously interprets video data - dynamic elements (motion) and static details (content) - using a shared encoder 3.

Good news!", "content_text": "Hello everyone! Good news! The long-awaited Yuna Ai V4 Miru model was finally released: yukiarimo/yuna-ai-v4-miru Now, she can see both images and videos! She has internal knowledge of multiple languages, including primary English, Japanese, and Russian, and she has a built-in ability for Quantum Thinking! Note that half of the features might be unstable. That\u2019s why, for the next half-year, we will not be writing a dataset; it will be created on the fly as she lives! Eventually, she will learn the needed skills in the upcoming interactions! This is a unique model\u2014the first vision model of Yuna with almost 12B parameters (closer to the atomic version, but smarter)! Weights are already on the hub, and support with good documentation will come in a week. Have fun!
