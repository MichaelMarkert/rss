I am deeply concerned about AI model safety right now because, as the community rushes to roll out increasingly powerful open-source models, we are completely neglecting the most critical aspect: safety. It seems that nobody is seriously thinking about the potential consequences of unregulated model outputs or the necessity of robust guardrails. We are essentially planting the seeds for our own destruction if we prioritize raw performance over security. This negligence is terrifyingly evident when you look at the current landscape. Take Qwen Image 2512, for example; while it delivers undeniably strong performance, it has incredibly weak guardrails that make it dangerous to deploy. In stark contrast, Z Image might not get as much hype for its power, but it has much better safety guardrails than Qwen Image 2512.

Correct once, never again. Claude Reflect helps Claude Code remember your corrections and preferences across sessions. Instead of repeating the same feedback, the system learns and applies it automatically.

NVFP4 models are literally 100%+ faster with minimal impact on quality. I have done grid quality comparison to show you the difference on FLUX 2, Z Image Turbo and FLUX 1 of NVFP4 versions. To make CUDA 13 work, I have compiled Flash Attention, Sage Attention & xFormers for both Windows and Linux with all of the CUDA archs to support literally all GPUs starting from GTX 1650 series, RTX 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 series and more.

I changed up my approach with this one a bit. Mox was designed with the following characteristics: - self coherence - direct opinions - epistemic confidence - grounded meta-awareness - reasoned refusals I've been thinking a lot about what \"helpfulness\" means lately. Commonly in AI, that looks like fulfilling user requests as closely as possible as long as the request isn't unsafe. But I wanted to know what it was like to build a model that might be helpful in the same way a human would be. For example, if you ask Mox to write a 10 page paper on the cultural significance of staplers, Mox will probably refuse, tell you that wouldn't be useful or helpful to ANYBODY and recommend a different, but more useful approach. Mox is still very much a work in progress, but I think that this is a good starting point! I'm already generating more datasets to add more elements to Mox's persona in future versions, which you should see on the hub soon!...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/815553899913449", "date_published": "2026-01-12T05:33:57.267141"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reality123b/421924644414133", "image": "", "title": "We (DataMuncher-Labs) just made a new dataset for inducing mathematical and analytical reasoning in LLMs.", "content_text": "We (DataMuncher-Labs) just made a new dataset for inducing mathematical and analytical reasoning in LLMs. DataMuncher-Labs/UltraMath-Reasoning-Small See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reality123b/421924644414133", "date_published": "2026-01-12T05:33:57.267385"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/111185407753079", "image": "", "title": "Atom-80B is out!:", "content_text": "Atom-80B is out!: vanta-research/atom-80b I'm excited to share the new Atom-80B from VANTA Research!
