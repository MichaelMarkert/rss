It's poorly documented, but the code should be straightforward. https://github.com/jim-plus/llm-abliteration The code is built atop a fork that enabled abliteration to be performed on models loaded in 4-bit or 8-bit bitsandbytes quantization. TransformerLens is not required, just plain Transformers. For those previously unaware, this opens up abliteration experimentation to more people with local VRAM limitations. Since performing abliteration on a quant involves precision and perplexity loss, it stands to reason that a small amount of magnitude sparsification could filter out some noise and possibly even reduce the damage inflicted on latent space via ablation of the refusal vector. There's a small but real acceleration of ablation of the refusal vector by reducing outer product operations from O(d\u00b2\u00d7n) to O(d\u00d7n), and then by pushing said computation layerwise to GPU.
