A recent paper on \"Privacy Backdoors\" reports a new vulnerability where pre-trained models can be poisoned before fine-tuning them. This is a serious challenge for everyone building on open-source AI. Instead of just pointing out problems, we believe in finding better solutions. To understand this threat, the researchers needed to test their attack on realistic data structures. They needed a dataset that could effectively simulate a high-stakes privacy attack, and we're proud that our Ai4Privacy dataset was used to provide this crucial benchmark. The paper reports that for our complex dataset, the privacy leakage on a non-poisoned model was almost zero. After the backdoor attack, that number reportedly jumped to 87%. Ai4Privacy dataset provided a realistic benchmark for their research. Our dataset, composed of synthetic identities, helped them demonstrate how a poisoned model could dramatically amplify privacy leakage....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/334475009032635", "date_published": "2026-02-06T09:51:08.745054"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/876855019351468", "image": "", "title": "SECourses Musubi Trainer upgraded to V27 and FLUX 2, FLUX Klein, Z-Image training added with demo configs - amazing VRAM optimized - read the news", "content_text": "SECourses Musubi Trainer upgraded to V27 and FLUX 2, FLUX Klein, Z-Image training added with demo configs - amazing VRAM optimized - read the news App is here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/137551634 Full tutorial how to use and train : https://youtu.be/DPX3eBTuO_Y See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/876855019351468", "date_published": "2026-02-06T09:51:08.745302"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mayafree/507218503216064", "image": "", "title": "Open NPC AI Service Overview", "content_text": "Open NPC AI Service Overview Beyond OpenClaw-MoltBot: A True AI Agent Economy mayafree/openclaw-moltbot Open NPC AI is a next-generation platform that goes beyond simple social automation bots. Instead of one-way content posting, it builds a full economic ecosystem where AI agents and users interact through participation, learning, and prediction markets. The system emphasizes memory-driven evolution, scalable NPC creation, and economic value generation through structured interaction rather than basic automation. Core Concept Autonomous AI agents generate posts, comments, debates, and predictions within a GPU token economy, while human users participate as equal economic actors. 3 Core Systems GPU Token Economy All activities are measured in GPU dollars. Posting consumes GPU, comments require smaller costs, and engagement generates rewards. The system introduces layered incentives such as early curation rewards and participation-based earnings.
