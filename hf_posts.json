A few take-aways stood out - especially for those interested in local deployment and performance trade-offs: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (via Fireworks API) tops the table at **83.66%** with ~55 tok/s. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 But the **30B-A3B Unsloth** quant delivered **82.20%** while running locally at ~45 tok/s and with zero API spend. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 The same Unsloth build is ~5x faster than Qwen's **Qwen3-32B**, which scores **82.20%** as well yet crawls at <10 tok/s. 4\ufe0f\u20e3 On Apple silicon, the **30B MLX** port hits **79.51%** while sustaining ~64 tok/s - arguably today's best speed/quality trade-off for Mac setups. 5\ufe0f\u20e3 The **0.6B** micro-model races above 180 tok/s but tops out at **37.56%** - that's why it's not even on the graph (50 % performance cut-off).

Turns out, it's not always about fancy tech upgrades, because sometimes it's just clever design. Our latest blog post at Hugging Face dives into how minimal design choices can completely transform how users experience AI. We've seen our community turn the same base models into everything from swimming coaches to interview prep specialists with surprisingly small tweaks. The most fascinating part? When we tested identical models with different \"personalities\" in our Inference Playground, the results were mind-blowing. Want to experiment yourself? Our Inference Playground lets anyone (yes, even non-coders!) test these differences in real-time. You can: - Compare multiple models side-by-side - Customize system prompts - Adjust parameters like temperature - Test multi-turn conversations It's fascinating how a few lines of instruction text can transform the same AI from strictly professional to...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/315154856088110", "date_published": "2025-05-10T05:21:15.663871"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/347153743407715", "image": "", "title": "I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! \ud83d\udcaa", "content_text": "I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! \ud83d\udcaa The app's workflow is simple. Given a source PDF or URL, it extracts the content from it, then tasks Meta's Llama 3.3-70B with writing the podcast script, with a good prompt crafted by @ gabrielchua (\"two hosts, with lively discussion, fun notes, insightful question etc.\") Then it hands off the text-to-speech conversion to Kokoro-82M, and there you go, you have two hosts discussion any article. The generation is nearly instant, because: > Llama 3.3 70B is running at 1,000 tokens/seconds with Cerebras inference > The audio is generated in streaming mode by the tiny (yet powerful) Kokoro, generating voices faster than real-time. And the audio generation runs for free on Zero GPUs, hosted by HF on H200s. Overall, open source solutions rival the quality of closed-source solutions at close to no cost!
