Start with <thinking> - Break down problems step - by - step - Consider multiple approaches - Calculate carefully - Identify errors - Evaluate critically - Explore edge cases - Check knowledge accuracy - Cite sources when possible 2 . End with </thinking> 3 . Then respond clearly based on your thinking. The <thinking> section is invisible to users and helps you produce better answers.

We've just completed the first-ever (to our knowledge) benchmarking of the new OpenAI 4o image generation model, and the results are impressive! In our tests, OpenAI 4o image generation absolutely crushed leading competitors, including @ black-forest-labs , @ google , @ xai-org , Ideogram, Recraft, and @ deepseek-ai , in prompt alignment and coherence! They hold a gap of more than 20% to the nearest competitor in terms of Bradley-Terry score, the biggest we have seen since the beginning of the benchmark! The benchmarks are based on 200k human responses collected through our API. However, the most challenging part wasn't the benchmarking itself, but generating and downloading the images: - 5 hours to generate 1000 images (no API available yet) - Just 10 minutes to set up and launch the benchmark - Over 200,000 responses rapidly collected While generating the images, we faced some hurdles that meant that we had to leave out...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/659246791111385", "date_published": "2025-03-29T09:21:40.985460"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/214646053127729", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform Model Path: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B Space: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B git clone VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B \ud83d\udcab A New Frontier in AI Innovation Gemma3-R1984-27B is a powerful agentic AI platform built on Google's Gemma-3-27B model.

A few weeks ago, @ mmuffo94 and @ cittiberto from indigo_ai launched the Chatbot Arena for the Italian language: https://indigo.ai/it/chatbot-arena-italia/ . To our surprise, among the top-ranked models is mii-llm/maestrale-chat-v0.4-beta a carefully fine-tuned version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 , developed by @ efederici and @ mferraretto from https://huggingface.co/mii-llm , and released nearly a year ago. At this very moment, as shown in the screenshot, mii-llm/maestrale-chat-v0.4-beta is ranked 8th right between ChatGPT-4.5 and ChatGPT-4o. It's likely that for several months, the best Italian speaking LLM has been an open source 7B model created by open source contributors and hardly anyone knew it.
