With native whopping 2560x2560 pixels image output capability and with only 12 steps it is next level. With our installers and specially made Quant FP8 Scaled model, you can run this amazing beast even as low as 6 GB GPUs. In this tutorial, I have compared Qwen Image Edit 2511 with previous successor model Qwen Image 2509 with 12 different unique and hard prompts and cases.

That said, we know many developers are comfortable with the classic layout (Postman / Bruno-style), where multiple sections can stay open at once.What would you prefer? - A new, focused single-section layout - The classic multi-section layout - A toggle that lets you choose between both?

The \"Attractive Metadata Attack\" paper details this stealthy new threat. To measure the real-world impact of their attack, the researchers needed a source of sensitive data for the agent to leak. We're proud that the AI4Privacy corpus was used to create the synthetic user profiles containing standardized PII for their experiments. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helped researchers Kanghua Mo, \u9f99\u6631\u4e1e, Zhihao Li from Guangzhou University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to not just demonstrate a new attack, but also quantify its potential for harm. This data-driven evidence is what pushes the community to build better, execution-level defenses for AI agents. \ud83d\udd17 Check out their paper to see how easily an agent's trust in tool metadata could be exploited: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110 #OpenSource #DataPrivacy #LLM #Anonymization...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/284489022074040", "date_published": "2025-12-27T05:26:15.590383"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/419718257011904", "image": "", "title": "You can now run GLM-4.7, the new 355B parameter SOTA model on your local device (128GB RAM).\u2728", "content_text": "You can now run GLM-4.7, the new 355B parameter SOTA model on your local device (128GB RAM).\u2728 The model achieves SOTA performance on coding, agentic and chat benchmarks.

They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.

BaseUtil is a new core component; aka src.geofractal.router.base_util inherits BaseComponent's behavior, so it should allow device movement for util operations which will direct utilization for device-to-device behavior for the upcoming accelerate integration. I'm trying to mitigate the base component structure as much as possible, but the need to chain components in specific orders presented a unique problem. By compartmentalizing utils into structures that can be delegated and moved, these structures can be repurposed, expanded autonomously, reduced autonomously, and more.
