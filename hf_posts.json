Kanon 2 Embedder is my most advanced model to date. On MLEB, it benchmarks as 9% more accurate than OpenAI's best embedding model and 30% faster. Even when truncated from 1,792 to 768 dimensions, Kanon 2 Embedder continues to hold the number one spot on MLEB. Importantly, Kanon 2 Embedder is also privacy and security friendly \u2014 unlike Voyage, Cohere and Jina, none of your data is used to train our models by default. Kanon 2 Embedder can also be self-hosted for enterprises with heightened security or reliability requirements.
