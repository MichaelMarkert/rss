With advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL), machines are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of making decisions autonomously. This shift is having a significant impact on society as we know it. One of the most notable aspects of RL is its ability to learn from experience. By observing and interacting with its surroundings, an AI-driven RL system can adapt to new situations and make decisions based on real-world data. This has huge implications for industries like healthcare, where AI can be used to analyze patient data and provide personalized treatment plans, or finance, where it can help predict market trends and make more informed investment decisions. Furthermore, RL is driving innovation in robotics and automation. Autonomous vehicles, for example, rely on RL to navigate complex environments safely...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ghostai1/378992241286931", "date_published": "2025-06-19T09:26:38.448830"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/682969091190201", "image": "", "title": "WAN 2.1 FusionX + Self Forcing LoRA are the New Best of Local Video Generation with Only 8 Steps + FLUX Upscaling Guide :", "content_text": "WAN 2.1 FusionX + Self Forcing LoRA are the New Best of Local Video Generation with Only 8 Steps + FLUX Upscaling Guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ Tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ Video Chapters 0:00 Introduction to the New FusionX Video Model & FLUX Upscaling 0:30 One-Click Presets & The SwarmUI Model Downloader Explained 1:07 Achieving Hyper-Realism with the FLUX 2x Latent Upscale Preset 1:58 How to Download & Install the SwarmUI Model Downloader 2:49 Downloading Full Models vs. Downloading Just The LoRAs 3:48 Final Setup: Updating SwarmUI & Importing The New Presets 4:32 Generating a Video: Applying the FusionX Image-to-Video Preset 5:03 Critical Step: Correcting The Model's Native Resolution Metadata 5:55 Finalizing Image-to-Video Settings (Frame Count & RIFE Interpolation) 6:49 Troubleshooting Performance: Identifying Low GPU Usage & Shared VRAM Bug 8:35 The Solution: Disabling Sage Attention for Image-to-Video Models 10:02 Final Result:...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/682969091190201", "date_published": "2025-06-19T09:26:38.449290"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/667885440717862", "image": "", "title": "\ud83c\udfaf Open GAMMA - AI PPT Generator 'GamJa'", "content_text": "\ud83c\udfaf Open GAMMA - AI PPT Generator 'GamJa' \ud83d\ude80 Project Introduction Revolutionary AI presentation generator presented by OpenFree AI Community!
