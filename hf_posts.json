Whether you're creating a custom portrait or just having fun, this feature brings your pet photos to life in completely new ways. And here\u2019s a little secret: although it\u2019s designed with dogs in mind, it actually works on any photo \u2014 cats, plush toys, even humans. Feel free to experiment! Results may not always be perfectly accurate, sometimes your photo might come back looking a little different, or even beyond your imagination. But that\u2019s part of the fun!
