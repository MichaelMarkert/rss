Every language carries its own cultural values and worldviews. So, when we build AI systems, we're not just deciding how they speak but also whose perspectives they represent. Even choosing which dialect to train on in Norway becomes a question of inclusion and power. In Kenya, will AI speak Swahili from Nairobi or coastal regions? What about indigenous languages with rich oral traditions but limited written text, like Quechua in Peru or Cherokee in North America? The path forward? Building WITH communities, not just FOR them. Working with local partners (libraries, universities, civil society), testing for cultural alignment, and asking hard questions about representation. Just published some thoughts on this after my keynote in Norway a few weeks ago: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/when-ai-speaks See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/887797954746272", "date_published": "2025-06-20T17:20:51.186029"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/819283171637748", "image": "", "title": "stop using VLMs blindly \u270b\ud83c\udffb", "content_text": "stop using VLMs blindly \u270b\ud83c\udffb compare different VLM outputs on a huge variety of inputs (from reasoning to OCR!) \ud83d\udd25 visionLMsftw/comparevlms > has support for multiple VLMs: google/gemma-3-27b-it , Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct , Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct , meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct , HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-2.2B-Instruct > recommend us new models or inputs, we'll add \ud83e\udee1 so far I figured out > for fact-checks, you need a relatively bigger size (7B is ok!) > Gemma 3 gets downgrade without pan and scan (especially for \ud83d\udcd1) > Qwen2.5VL-32B is very talkative, great for reasoning but not good for simple tasks \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/819283171637748", "date_published": "2025-06-20T17:20:51.186419"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/412568329805459", "image": "", "title": "DeepThink Plugin: Bringing Gemini 2.5's Parallel Reasoning to Open Models", "content_text": "DeepThink Plugin: Bringing Gemini 2.5's Parallel Reasoning to Open Models Just released an open-source plugin that implements Google's \"Deep Think\" reasoning approach for models like DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, and other open models. Google's recent Gemini 2.5 report introduced Deep Think - a technique where models generate multiple hypotheses in parallel and critique them before arriving at final answers. It achieves SOTA results on math olympiads and competitive coding benchmarks. Our implementation works by modifying the inference pipeline to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously, then synthesizing the best approach. Instead of single-pass generation, models run an internal debate before responding. Key features: - Works with any model that supports structured reasoning patterns - Implements parallel thinking during response generation - Particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks, math, and coding problems - Increases inference time but significantly improves answer...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/412568329805459", "date_published": "2025-06-20T17:20:51.186893"}]}
