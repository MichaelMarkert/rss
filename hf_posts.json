The \"Attractive Metadata Attack\" paper details this stealthy new threat. To measure the real-world impact of their attack, the researchers needed a source of sensitive data for the agent to leak. We're proud that the AI4Privacy corpus was used to create the synthetic user profiles containing standardized PII for their experiments. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helped researchers Kanghua Mo, \u9f99\u6631\u4e1e, Zhihao Li from Guangzhou University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to not just demonstrate a new attack, but also quantify its potential for harm. This data-driven evidence is what pushes the community to build better, execution-level defenses for AI agents. \ud83d\udd17 Check out their paper to see how easily an agent's trust in tool metadata could be exploited: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110 #OpenSource #DataPrivacy #LLM #Anonymization...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/284489022074040", "date_published": "2025-12-28T09:26:09.142334"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/csabakecskemeti/254891528281591", "image": "", "title": "Just sharing a result of a homelab infrastructure experiment:", "content_text": "Just sharing a result of a homelab infrastructure experiment: I've managed to setup a distributed inference infra at home using a DGX Spark (128GB unified gddr6) and a linux workstation with an RTX 6000 Pro (96GB gddr7) connected via 100Gbps RoCEv2.
