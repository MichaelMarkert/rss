A fusion merge - of a fusion merge and a SLERP of a fusion and older merge - should demonstrate the new merge method's behavior in interesting ways, especially in the first 1/4th of the model where the SLERP has less impact.

For the past five years, we've been doing monthly releases featuring many models (v4.49.0, the latest release, features 9 new architectures). Starting with SmolVLM-2 & SigLIP2, we'll now additionally release tags supporting new models on a stable branch. These models are therefore directly available for use by installing from the tag itself. These tags will continue to be updated with fixes applied to these models. Going forward, continue expecting software releases following semantic versioning: v4.50.0 will have ~10 new architectures compared to v4.49.0, as well as a myriad of new features, improvements and bug fixes.
