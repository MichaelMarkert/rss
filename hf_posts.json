But can they follow the story?\ud83e\udd14 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!\u23f3 We test three skills that matter for real-world use: \ud83d\udd0e Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. \ud83e\udde9 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. \ud83c\udfc3 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging. We've found the breaking points\u2014now the community can start fixing them.\ud83d\udcc8 Want to learn more? TimeScope is 100% open-source.

Here are my notes on it: > MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) > Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. > They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 \"first dense\" layers in the dsv3 arch.
