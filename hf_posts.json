The field isn\u2019t standing still \u2013 new LoRA variants push the limits of efficiency, generalization, and personalization. So we\u2019re sharing 10 of the latest LoRA approaches you should know about: 1. Mixture-of-LoRA-experts \u2192 Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts in Generalizable Audio Deepfake Detection (2509.13878) Adds multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into a model\u2019s layers, and a routing mechanism activates the most suitable ones for each input.

NPU Dominance in Efficiency: - YOLOv11n: 1.72ms on NPU vs 53.60ms on CPU (31x faster) - Memory footprint: 0-65MB across all variants - Consistent sub-10ms inference even on XL models 2.

By limiting submissions to only freshly published code, we could evaluate based on consistency over time with rolling averages instead of finding agents overfit to a static benchmark. Can rolling benchmarks bring us closer to evaluating agents in a way more closely aligned with their real-world applications? Perhaps a new direction for agent evaluation?
