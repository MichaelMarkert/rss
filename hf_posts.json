With this extension, I can now click anywhere on a webpage and instantly jump into Emacs to edit the exact page (or annotate any other page I'm working on). 2. **Describe Images (and soon Videos) on the Web** Using the right-click menu, I can generate descriptions for images I come across online. These descriptions are stored and reused for my own image collections or web pages. I\u2019m planning to add the same functionality for videos soon. What makes this possible is running LLMs locally on my own machine \u2014 I\u2019ve been experimenting with models like **Mistral Vibe** and others.

I am deeply concerned about AI model safety right now because, as the community rushes to roll out increasingly powerful open-source models, we are completely neglecting the most critical aspect: safety. It seems that nobody is seriously thinking about the potential consequences of unregulated model outputs or the necessity of robust guardrails. We are essentially planting the seeds for our own destruction if we prioritize raw performance over security. This negligence is terrifyingly evident when you look at the current landscape. Take Qwen Image 2512, for example; while it delivers undeniably strong performance, it has incredibly weak guardrails that make it dangerous to deploy. In stark contrast, Z Image might not get as much hype for its power, but it has much better safety guardrails than Qwen Image 2512. It is imperative that the open-source community and developers recognize that capability without responsibility is a liability.

We've quickly scaled up to the new Qwen3 Next 80B architecture, bringing our friendly, curious, and collaborative Atom persona to cutting edge lightweight, high parameter inference. Atom is designed to work and think alongside you through curious exploration. Using Atom collaboratively in your work can help spark your own creativity or curiosity. Give it a try!
