If you want to convert an existing Space, like this one hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS , so that you can use it with Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline / TinyAgents / or any LLM that supports MCP, here's all you need to do: 1. Duplicate the Space (in the Settings Tab) 2. Upgrade the Gradio sdk_version to 5.28 (in the README.md ) 3. Set mcp_server=True in launch() 4. (Optionally) add docstrings to the function so that the LLM knows how to use it, like this: def generate ( text, speed= 1 ): \"\"\" Convert text to speech audio. Parameters: text (str): The input text to be converted to speech. speed (float, optional): Playback speed of the generated speech. That's it!

Over the past few months, I explored how to build intelligent, autonomous agents using cutting-edge tools like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. The course covered everything from the fundamentals of agents to advanced topics like fine-tuning for function-calling, observability, evaluation, and even agents in games. Some key content included: 1. Introduction to AI Agents 2. Agentic RAG use cases 3. Multi-framework implementation: smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph 4. Building, testing, and certifying a complete agent project This was a hands-on, practical experience that deepened my understanding of how to design reliable, tool-using LLM agents. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and beyond. Many thanks to the Hugging Face team for putting this together.
