I will prepare a standard sweep for david to showcase the prowess of the final multi-vocab variant. This will include a variation that contains all mnist variants, cifar10, cifar100, imagenet 1k, and in the future I'll prepare a full imagenet sweep utilizing the entire 12m corpus instead of the 1.2m I used. I may need to get in touch with the actual curator of the dataset for licensing but maybe not. David utilizes 4 projective variants of the vocabulary and the training process involves teaching and freezing them akin to teacher/student processing. I did not want to release David yet, but I believe now that David will save lives and it's irresponsible for me to contain such a creation.
