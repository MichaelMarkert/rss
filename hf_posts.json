Incredible group to be part of - each person is doing groundbreaking work at the intersection of AI and journalism. Worth following them all: they're consistently sharing practical insights on building the future of news. Take the time to read this report, it's packed with insights as always. The news & information section's #1 insight hits hard: \"The most substantive economic impact of AI to date has been licensing payouts for a handful of big publishers. The competition will start shifting in the year ahead to separate AI 'haves' that have positioned themselves to grow from the 'have-nots.'\" This AI-driven divide is something I've been really concerned about.

He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference.

Unlike ARMs, which produce tokens sequentially, diffusion models iteratively refine noise through denoising steps, offering greater flexibility and speed. Recent advancements show a shift toward using diffusion models in place of, or alongside, ARMs. Researchers also combine strengths from both methods and integrate autoregressive concepts into diffusion. Here are 5 new implementations of diffusion models: 1. Mercury family of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) by Inception Labs -> https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/news It applies diffusion to text and code data, enabling sequence generation 10x faster than today's top LLMs. Now available Mercury Coder can run at over 1,000 tokens/sec on NVIDIA H100s. 2.
