FLOW : https://labs.google/flow/about Veo 3 is Google DeepMind\u2019s most advanced video generation model to date. It allows users to create high-quality, cinematic video clips from simple text prompts, making it one of the most powerful AI tools for video creation. What sets Veo 3 apart is its ability to generate videos with native audio. This means that along with stunning visuals, Veo 3 can produce synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music\u2014all from a single prompt. For filmmakers, this is a significant leap forward, as it eliminates the need for separate audio generation or complex syncing processes.
