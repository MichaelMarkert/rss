With this extension, I can now click anywhere on a webpage and instantly jump into Emacs to edit the exact page (or annotate any other page I'm working on). 2. **Describe Images (and soon Videos) on the Web** Using the right-click menu, I can generate descriptions for images I come across online. These descriptions are stored and reused for my own image collections or web pages. I\u2019m planning to add the same functionality for videos soon. What makes this possible is running LLMs locally on my own machine \u2014 I\u2019ve been experimenting with models like **Mistral Vibe** and others.

The \"Sim-to-Real\" gap is officially history. In early 2026, we are no longer just rendering data; we are simulating reality. By bridging Meta\u2019s SAM 3D, Unreal Engine, and the NVIDIA Cosmos suite, we\u2019ve built an autonomous pipeline for Physical AI that evolves itself. The 2026 Tech Stack: SAM 3D: Generates high-fidelity digital twins from 2D photos in seconds. Unreal Engine + MCP: The AI \"Director\" orchestrates environments via the Model Context Protocol, providing perfect Ground Truth. NeMo Data Designer: The orchestration hub on GitHub. Following NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of Gretel in early 2025, its leading generative privacy and tabular tech are now fully integrated here.
