I noticed that model cards usually have Transformers code as usage examples. So I tried to figure out how to load a model just using the transformers library without using ollama, lmstudio, or llamacpp. Learned how to install dependencies required to make it work like pytorch and CUDA. I also used Conda for python environment dependencies. Once I got the model loaded and sample inference working, I made an API to serve it. I know it's very basic stuff for machine learning experts here in HF but I'm completely new to this so I'm happy to get it working!

Last week I had the chance to give a short talk during the TigerBeetle 1000x World Tour (organized by @ jedisct1 \ud83d\udc4f ) a fantastic event celebrating high-performance engineering and the people who love pushing systems to their limits! In the talk, I focused on the CPU and Linux side of things, with a simple goal in mind: making the installation of llama.cpp instant, automatic, and optimal, no matter your OS or hardware setup. For the curious, here are the links worth checking out: Event page: https://tigerbeetle.com/event/1000x GitHub repo: https://github.com/angt/installama.sh Talk: https://youtu.be/pg5NOeJZf0o?si=9Dkcfi2TqjnT_30e More improvements are coming soon.

This is what usually happens: While debugging an API in the middle of a sprint, the API Client says that everything's fine, but the docs still show an old version. So you jump back to the code, find the updated response schema, then go back to the API Client, which gets stuck, forcing you to rerun the tests. Hours can go by just trying to sync all this up (and that\u2019s if you catch the inconsistencies at all). The reason? Using disconnected tools for specs, tests, and docs. Doing manual updates, stale docs, and a lot of context switching. Voiden takes a different approach: Puts specs, tests & docs all in one Markdown file, stored right in the repo. Everything stays in sync, versioned with Git, and updated in one place, inside your editor.
