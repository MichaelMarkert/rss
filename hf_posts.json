The current model places impossible burdens on users to manage countless consent decisions. Meanwhile, AI systems learn to mimic our voices and writing styles from data we unknowingly provided years ago. What's next? We need to shift from individual responsibility to collective accountability. This means: - Organizations designing systems that respect human agency by default - Developers building ethics into models from the start - Policymakers creating frameworks beyond minimal compliance Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/consentful-ai Paper: Can AI be Consentful?
