Anything that relies on torch.export or torch.compile, from model optimization to cross-framework integrations, benefits directly when models can be captured as a single dynamo-traced graph ! Transformers models are now easier to: \u2699\ufe0f Compile end-to-end with torch.compile backends \ud83d\udce6 Export reliably via torch.export and torch.onnx.export \ud83d\ude80 Deploy to ONNX / ONNX Runtime, Intel Corporation's OpenVINO, NVIDIA AutoDeploy (TRT-LLM), AMD's Quark, Meta's Executorch and more hardware-specific runtimes. This work aims at unblocking entire TorchDynamo-based toolchains that rely on exporting Transformers across runtimes and accelerators.

Key insight: treating each key as a single token enables perfect retrieval at unlimited context lengths. The article covers: - How HashHop works and why its perfect accuracy is suspicious - Building a tokenized solver that achieves 100% accuracy - Scaling to MALM for real code search tasks - Why this approach could handle 100M+ tokens Read the full article: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/reverse-engineering-magic-hashhop Try the model: codelion/malm-165m Code: https://github.com/codelion/hash-hop See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/260857666290873", "date_published": "2026-01-24T05:26:35.586503"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/827993286487533", "image": "", "title": "There is a new open-source music generation model called HeartMuLa.
