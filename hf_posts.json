So I built **SecureCode**: a collection of **8 code models (3B \u2192 20B)** trained to behave more like a security reviewer. What you should expect from SecureCode: - identify likely vuln patterns and explain *why* they\u2019re risky - outline plausible abuse paths (defensive framing) - propose a secure rewrite (drop-in where possible) - include defense-in-depth guidance + regression tests/checks Links: - **Models:** https://huggingface.co/collections/scthornton/securecode - **Dataset:** scthornton/securecode-v2 - **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/html/2512.18542v1 SecureCode v2.0: A Production-Grade Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models (2512.18542) **How to test it (copy/paste prompt):** > You are a...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/483996346337767", "date_published": "2026-01-28T09:39:06.042595"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/848772925772411", "image": "", "title": "Transformers v5 just landed! \ud83d\ude80", "content_text": "Transformers v5 just landed! \ud83d\ude80 It significantly unifies and reduces modeling code across architectures, while opening the door to a whole new class of performance optimizations. My favorite new feature? \ud83e\udd14 The new dynamic weight loader + converter. Here\u2019s why \ud83d\udc47 Over the last few months, the core Transformers maintainers built an incredibly fast weight loader, capable of converting tensors on the fly while loading them in parallel threads. This means we\u2019re no longer constrained by how parameters are laid out inside the safetensors weight files. In practice, this unlocks two big things: - Much more modular modeling code. You can now clearly see how architectures build on top of each other (DeepSeek v2 \u2192 v3, Qwen v2 \u2192 v3 \u2192 MoE, etc.). This makes shared bottlenecks obvious and lets us optimize the right building blocks once, for all model families. - Performance optimizations beyond what torch.compile can do alone. torch.compile operates on the computation graph, but it can\u2019t change...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/848772925772411", "date_published": "2026-01-28T09:39:06.043304"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/kelsend/790764867019535", "image": "", "title": "I'm absolutely stunned by the aesthetics of HunyuanImage-3.0", "content_text": "I'm absolutely stunned by the aesthetics of HunyuanImage-3.0 The visual effects of this model are simply beyond imagination it\u2019s every bit as good as NanoBanana, no compromise at all. I fine-tuned my micro-scene prompts by adding text overlays and background effects, and its adaptability is truly breathtaking. With just one prompt, you can generate scene posters for any movie or novel. Every detail, from scene design to text style and atmospheric effects, perfectly aligns with the tone of the original material. No forced elements, just seamless, film-grade visual effects that exactly match what I envisioned. \ud83d\udc49 Repo: https://hunyuan.tencent.com/chat/HunyuanDefault?from=modelSquare&modelId=Hunyuan-Image-3.0-Instruct See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/kelsend/790764867019535", "date_published": "2026-01-28T09:39:06.043756"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/425017162094241", "image": "", "title": "Date idea: read the entire Transformers v5.0.0 release notes", "content_text": "Date idea: read the entire Transformers v5.0.0 release notes Officially stable now: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v5.0.0 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/425017162094241", "date_published": "2026-01-28T09:39:06.043968"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/254137909606959", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Wanna train your own AI Model or Tokenizer from scratch?", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 Wanna train your own AI Model or Tokenizer from scratch?
