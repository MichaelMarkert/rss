I made this whilst prepping the next unit of the reasoning course: In this notebooks I combine together google\u2019s model with some community tooling - First, I load the model from the Hugging Face hub with transformers\u2019s latest release for Gemma 3 - I use PEFT and bitsandbytes to get it running on Colab - Then, I took Will Browns processing and reward functions to make reasoning chains from GSM8k - Finally, I used TRL\u2019s GRPOTrainer to train the model Next step is to bring Unsloth AI in, then ship it in the reasoning course.

Reading the tech report, and this section was really interesting to me from a methods/scientific fairness pov. Instead of doing over-hyped comparisons, they clearly state that **results are reported in a setup which is advantageous to their models**. (Which everybody does, but people usually don't say) For a tech report, it makes a lot of sense to report model performance when used optimally! On leaderboards on the other hand, comparison will be apples to apples, but in a potentially unoptimal way for a given model family (like some user interact sub-optimally with models) Also contains a cool section (6) on training data memorization rate too! Important to see if your model will output the training data it has seen as such: always an issue for privacy/copyright/... but also very much for evaluation! Because if your model knows its evals by heart, you're not testing for generalization.
