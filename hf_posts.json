It\u2019s no longer just about \"predicting the next token\"\u2014it\u2019s about executing latent plans on a high-speed data highway. What happens when we combine DeepSeek\u2019s stability with Google\u2019s strategic intelligence? 1\ufe0f\u20e3 The Infrastructure: DeepSeek\u2019s mHC Moving from a single-lane residual stream to a multi-lane highway. Using the Birkhoff Polytope, mHC ensures mathematical stability (Identity Mapping) while routing specialized data through dedicated lanes. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Intelligence: Google\u2019s Meta-Controller An internal AI unit that lives inside the Transformer. It escapes the \"Token Trap\" by extracting data to create a latent plan, steering the model via Temporal Abstraction. The Synergy: In a Topological Transformer, the Meta-Controller finally has the \"dedicated lanes\" it needs to steer complex reasoning without causing gradient explosions.

It's been a crazy year for me! This year I launched VANTA Research as a solo operator and managed to push out 14 original open source finetunes and 5 datasets in the span of about 4 months, completely on my own. The reception has been much higher than I ever anticipated and sincerely appreciate everyone that's checked out my work thus far. The good news is, I'm just getting started! In 2026 you can expect even more original models from VANTA Research, more open source datasets, and maybe some other cool things as well? \ud83d\udc40 2026 is gonna be big for AI in general, and I can't wait to experience it with all of you!

Threw it into Claude Code torture testing with 60+ tools, 8 agents (7 sub-agents because apparently one wasn't enough chaos). It didn't even flinch. Extremely fast, scary good at coding.
