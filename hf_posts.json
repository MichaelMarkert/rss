FLOW : https://labs.google/flow/about Veo 3 is Google DeepMind\u2019s most advanced video generation model to date. It allows users to create high-quality, cinematic video clips from simple text prompts, making it one of the most powerful AI tools for video creation. What sets Veo 3 apart is its ability to generate videos with native audio. This means that along with stunning visuals, Veo 3 can produce synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music\u2014all from a single prompt. For filmmakers, this is a significant leap forward, as it eliminates the need for separate audio generation or complex syncing processes.

App-Use lets you scope agents to just the apps they need. Instead of full desktop access, say \"only work with Safari and Notes\" or \"just control iPhone Mirroring\" - visual isolation without new processes for perfectly focused automation. Running computer-use on the entire desktop often causes agent hallucinations and loss of focus when they see irrelevant windows and UI elements. App-Use solves this by creating composited views where agents only see what matters, dramatically improving task completion accuracy What you can build: Research agents working in Safari while writing agents draft in Notes, iPhone automation for messages and reminders, parallel testing across isolated app sessions, or teams of specialized agents working simultaneously without interference. Currently macOS-only (Quartz compositing engine).
