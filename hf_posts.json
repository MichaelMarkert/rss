They're added on top of the v4.49.0 release, and can be installed from the following tags: v4.49.0-SmolVLM-2 and v4.49.0-SigLIP-2 . This marks a new beginning for the release process of transformers. For the past five years, we've been doing monthly releases featuring many models (v4.49.0, the latest release, features 9 new architectures). Starting with SmolVLM-2 & SigLIP2, we'll now additionally release tags supporting new models on a stable branch. These models are therefore directly available for use by installing from the tag itself. These tags will continue to be updated with fixes applied to these models. Going forward, continue expecting software releases following semantic versioning: v4.50.0 will have ~10 new architectures compared to v4.49.0, as well as a myriad of new features, improvements and bug fixes. Accompanying these software releases, we'll release tags offering brand new models as fast as...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/lysandre/966361810633890", "date_published": "2025-02-23T13:21:30.937850"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/319015417669347", "image": "", "title": "It's really interesting about the deployment of a new state of matter in Majorana 1: the world\u2019s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits.
