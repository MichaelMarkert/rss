For any AI agent, internet search \ud83d\udd0e is an important tool. However, with APIs like Tavily and Exa, it becomes really difficult to keep up with the cost. In some cases, these Internet APIs cost more than the LLM. To solve, this, I am making a playwright wrapper API on top of publicly available searXNG instances. This will enable agent applications to fetch internet results for free. Currently, I have set up a basic GitHub repo, and I will continue developing advanced search features, such as image search \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Github: https://github.com/HanzlaJavaid/Free-Search/tree/main \ud83d\ude80 Try the deployed version: https://freesearch.replit.app/docs If you find this useful, consider starring \u2b50\ufe0f the GitHub repository to support further development!

Since token order matters, RoPE encodes it by rotating token embeddings based on their position, so the model knows how to interpret which token comes first, second, and so on. Here are 8 types of RoPE that can be implemented in different cases: 1. Original RoPE -> RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (2104.09864) Encodes token positions by rotating token embeddings in the complex plane via a position-based rotation matrix, thereby providing the self-attention mechanism with relative positional info. 2. LongRoPE -> LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens (2402.13753) Extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to 2048k tokens, leveraging non-uniformities in positional interpolation with an efficient search. 3.
