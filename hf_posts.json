I've been busy working on some new ranking/position methodologies and excited to start sharing some results. Plot legends: - X = truncation rate (low = good) - ? = confusion rate (low = good) - blue bars = average completion tokens (low = good) - black diamonds = CI-banded performance (high = good) - cluster squares = models inside this group are equivalent openai/gpt-oss-120b remains the king in all dimensions of interest: truncation rates, completion lengths and performance. If I had but one complaint it's the reason_effort does not seem to actually work - more on this soon. Second is a 3-way tie in performance between the Qwen3-235B-2507 we all know and love with an unexpected entrant - ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct This is a very capable model and it's reasoning effort controls actually works, but you should absolutely not leave it on the default \"unlimited\" - enable a sensible limit (4k works well for 8k context length).

To build a truly reliable privacy pipeline, you have to test it. A new Master's thesis does just that, and our data was there for every step. We're excited to showcase this work on handling confidential data in LLM prompts from Nedim Karavdic at M\u00e4lardalen University. To build their PII anonymization pipeline, they first trained a custom NER model. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset was used as the foundational training data for this critical first step. But it didn't stop there. The research also used our dataset to create the parallel data needed to train and test the generative \"Seek\" models for de-anonymization. It's a win-win when our open-source data not only helps build the proposed \"better solution\" but also helps prove why it's better by enabling a rigorous, data-driven comparison. \ud83d\udd17 Check out the full thesis for a great deep-dive into building a practical, end-...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/647817712633860", "date_published": "2026-01-02T09:29:52.822988"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049", "image": "", "title": "As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out", "content_text": "As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out Reubencf/Nano_Banana_Editor looking forward to build and release more in the future for the open source community See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049", "date_published": "2026-01-02T09:29:52.823245"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/444530398664756", "image": "", "title": "gRPC support in Voiden", "content_text": "gRPC support in Voiden gRPC has become a popular choice for building high-performance, scalable APIs, especially in microservices and real-time systems. Unlike traditional REST APIs, gRPC uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers to deliver fast, efficient communication with strong typing and contract enforcement. Many developers in our community asked for it, so we have now added gRPC support in the latest Voiden release.You can now test and document gRPC APIs side-by-side with your REST and WebSocket APIs. Keep everything in one file-centric, Git-native workflow. Use reusable blocks and version control for gRPC requests, just like any other API call.

What is Git GUI, and how does it help here ? Git GUI makes version control visual, predictable, and easier to reason about especially when things go wrong. That\u2019s exactly why we built Git GUI in Voiden. Instead of relying on memorized commands, Voiden lets you see what Git is doing before it does it. What Voiden\u2019s Git GUI helps developers do \u2022 View exact file and line-level changes before committing \u2022 Stage only intended changes (no accidental commits) \u2022 Clearly distinguish staged vs unstaged files \u2022 Inspect visual diffs with full context \u2022 Understand branches, commit history, and repo state instantly When Git behavior is hidden, errors increase. Voiden\u2019s Git GUI doesn\u2019t abstract Git away, it explains Git. Whether you\u2019re new to Git or an experienced developer who prefers clarity, this is Git you can reason about. Version control should feel safe, not stressful.

AI systems need to remember past interactions, update knowledge, stay consistent over time, and work beyond a single prompt. That's why many start to talk more about memory in AI. Here\u2019s a useful set of studies and videos on where AI memory stands today: 1. Memory in the Age of AI Agents (2512.13564) A great survey that organizes agent memory research.
