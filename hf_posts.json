To make a research survey, you generally follow two steps, preparation (collect and organize papers) and writing (outline creation, writing, polishing). Researchers followed the same two steps and automated them. \ud83c\udfaf For the preparation part, a key part is find all the important references on the given subject. Researchers first cast a wide net of all relevant papers. But then finding the really important ones is like distilling knowledge from a haystack of information. To solve this challenge, they built an \u201cAttributeTree\u201d object that structures key information from citations.

Been testing all these tools myself and created a searchable collection of the most practical ones - from audio transcription to image generation to document analysis. No coding needed, no expensive subscriptions. Some highlights I've tested personally: - Private, on-device transcription with speaker ID in 100+ languages using Whisper - Website scraping that just works - paste a URL, get structured data - Local image editing with tools like Finegrain (impressive results) - Document chat using Qwen 2.5 72B (handles technical papers well) Sharing this early because the best tools come from the community.

One side features @ jpacifico 's jpacifico/Chocolatine-2-14B-Instruct-v2.0.3 and the other features @ suayptalha 's suayptalha/Lamarckvergence-14B paired with my models which were their merge ancestors. A fusion merge - of a fusion merge and a SLERP of a fusion and older merge - should demonstrate the new merge method's behavior in interesting ways, especially in the first 1/4th of the model where the SLERP has less impact. I welcome you to kick the tires and learn from it. It has prose quality near Qwenvergence v12's - as you'd expect.

I've got my hands on an AMD Instinct MI100. It's about the same price used as a V100 but on paper has more TOPS (V100 14TOPS vs MI100 23TOPS) also the HBM has faster clock so the memory bandwidth is 1.2TB/s. For quantized inference it's a beast (MI50 was also surprisingly fast) For LORA training with this quick test I could not make the bnb config works so I'm running the FT on the fill size model.
