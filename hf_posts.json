I'm really grateful for the positive response to the Claude Reflect System. In just 4 days, 30 developers have shown interest by starring the project. Thank you so much! What Is Claude Reflect? Correct once, never again. Claude Reflect helps Claude Code remember your corrections and preferences across sessions. Instead of repeating the same feedback, the system learns and applies it automatically. Main Features: \ud83e\udde0 Learning System - Detects corrections and preferences from conversations - Stores them permanently in skill files - Applies learnings in future sessions \ud83d\udd12 Safety First - Automatic backups before changes - YAML validation - Git version control \u26a1 Two Modes - Manual: Run /reflect when you want - Auto: Reflects automatically at session end How It Works If you correct Claude to use pytest instead of unittest, this preference gets saved. Next time, Claude will remember and use pytest...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/535995505101203", "date_published": "2026-01-13T13:45:00.028960"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/526284345540053", "image": "", "title": "Our engineer Alan from", "content_text": "Our engineer Alan from https://robonine.com team has assembled the mechanical frame of our 6-DoF manipulator prototype - without servo motors for now.

We're highlighting a solution-oriented report from researchers Sahana Naganandh, Vaibhav V, and Thenmozhi M at Vellore Institute of Technology that investigates this exact challenge. The direct connection to our mission is clear: the paper showcases the PII43K dataset as a privacy-preserving alternative to high-risk, raw multilingual data The report notes that our dataset, with its structured anonymization, is a \"useful option for privacy-centric AI applications.\" It's always a delight when academic research independently validates our data-first approach to solving real-world privacy problems. This is how we build a safer AI future together. \ud83d\udd17 Read the full report here to learn more: https://assets.cureusjournals.com/artifacts/upload/technical_report/pdf/3689/20250724-59151-93w9ar.pdf \ud83d\ude80 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI\u2014follow us on LinkedIn:...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/151930847327570", "date_published": "2026-01-13T13:45:00.030104"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/671443723641634", "image": "", "title": "NVFP4 With CUDA 13 Full Tutorial, 100%+ Speed Gain + Quality Comparison & New Cheap Cloud SimplePod", "content_text": "NVFP4 With CUDA 13 Full Tutorial, 100%+ Speed Gain + Quality Comparison & New Cheap Cloud SimplePod Full tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOj9PYq3XYM Finally NVFP4 models has arrived to ComfyUI thus SwarmUI with CUDA 13. NVFP4 models are literally 100%+ faster with minimal impact on quality. I have done grid quality comparison to show you the difference on FLUX 2, Z Image Turbo and FLUX 1 of NVFP4 versions. To make CUDA 13 work, I have compiled Flash Attention, Sage Attention & xFormers for both Windows and Linux with all of the CUDA archs to support literally all GPUs starting from GTX 1650 series, RTX 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 series and more. In this full tutorial, I will show you how to upgrade your ComfyUI and thus SwarmUI to use latest CUDA 13 with latest libraries and Torch 2.9.1.

I changed up my approach with this one a bit. Mox was designed with the following characteristics: - self coherence - direct opinions - epistemic confidence - grounded meta-awareness - reasoned refusals I've been thinking a lot about what \"helpfulness\" means lately. Commonly in AI, that looks like fulfilling user requests as closely as possible as long as the request isn't unsafe. But I wanted to know what it was like to build a model that might be helpful in the same way a human would be. For example, if you ask Mox to write a 10 page paper on the cultural significance of staplers, Mox will probably refuse, tell you that wouldn't be useful or helpful to ANYBODY and recommend a different, but more useful approach. Mox is still very much a work in progress, but I think that this is a good starting point! I'm already generating more datasets to add more elements to Mox's persona in future versions, which you should see on the hub soon!...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/815553899913449", "date_published": "2026-01-13T13:45:00.031153"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/141864984025794", "image": "", "title": "I\u2019m looking for AI engineers and researchers to join my company as part of the core team.
