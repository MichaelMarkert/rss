NoesisLab/Spartacus-1B-Instruct We have successfully replaced the KV-cache bottleneck inherent in Softmax Attention with Causal Monoid State Compression. By defining the causal history as a monoid recurrence, , the entire prefix is lossily compressed into a fixed-size state matrix per head. The technical core of this architecture relies on the associativity of the monoid operator: Training: parallel prefix scan using Triton-accelerated JIT kernels to compute all prefix states simultaneously. Inference: True sequential updates. Memory and time complexity per token are decoupled from sequence length. Explicit Causality: We discard RoPE and attention masks. Causality is a first-class citizen, explicitly modeled through learned, content-dependent decay gates. Current zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that Spartacus-1B-Instruct (1.3B) is already outperforming established sub-quadratic models like Mamba-1.4B and...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/OzTianlu/866420978580038", "date_published": "2026-02-20T14:02:09.470152"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/qgallouedec/326351655871382", "image": "", "title": "@CohereLabs", "content_text": "@ CohereLabs just released \ud83c\udf3f Tiny Aya: a fully open-source 3B parameter model that speaks 70+ languages \ud83c\udf0d! But there\u2019s a catch: Tiny Aya is just a language model. It doesn\u2019t support tool calling, the key capability that turns frontier models into powerful *agents*. So the real question is: How hard is it to turn Tiny Aya into an agent? Turns out\u2026 it\u2019s simple, thanks to Hugging Face TRL. We\u2019re sharing a hands-on example showing how to train Tiny Aya to turn it into a tool-calling agent using TRL, unlocking what could become the first *massively multilingual open agent*.

What makes this particular invariant special, is the existence within all structures I've tested so far. I had Claude write up the direct article based on what we built together, but I've tested it on many substructures. This is flawed, and I have a series of answers to making it more accurate. First a reconstruction from the ground up. This means each shape is specifically built upward from the substructure to the point of inductive deviance. This will be less quick at first and then build speed as I optimize like the last system did. The \"saddle\" problem; the system detected saddles because there wasn't enough deviance in the shapes to attenuate to more cardinality and more aligned substructures. The blobs were around 30-40% of the overall patches, which interpolated into the others produced a fair approximation. It MOST DEFINITELY did see those shapes in their voxel complexity.
