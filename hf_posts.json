Diffusers just added support for another caching method: First Block Cache - a technique developed by @ chengzeyi building upon the ideas of TeaCache. The idea in short is: if the model predictions do not vary much over successive inference steps, we can skip certain steps where the prediction difference is small. To figure out whether an inference step will make a significant improvement to the overall velocity/noise prediction, we calculate the relative difference of the output of the first transformer block at timestep $t$ with $t-1$, and compare it against a selected threshold. If the difference is lower than the threshold, we skip the step. A higher threshold will lead to more steps being skipped. However, skipping many steps is bad because it can throw off the model predictions, and so we need to test and select the threshold based on level of quality-speed tradeoff...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/278025275110164", "date_published": "2025-07-11T13:35:34.051566"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/958744591263435", "image": "", "title": "I've been posting bits and pieces about this research, but now I can finally say: new paper alert \ud83d\udea8", "content_text": "I've been posting bits and pieces about this research, but now I can finally say: new paper alert \ud83d\udea8 My colleague @ brunatrevelin and I just shared a paper exploring why traditional consent frameworks are breaking down in AI contexts (forthcoming chapter in a collective book). The current model places impossible burdens on users to manage countless consent decisions. Meanwhile, AI systems learn to mimic our voices and writing styles from data we unknowingly provided years ago. What's next? We need to shift from individual responsibility to collective accountability.
