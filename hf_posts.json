The transformer architecture is cursed by its computational complexity. It is why you run out of tokens and have to compact. But some would argue that this is a feature not a bug and that this is also why these models are so good. We've been doing a lot of research on trying to make equally good models that are computationally cheaper, But so far, none of the approaches have stood the test of time. Or so it seems. Please vote, don't be shy. Remember that the Dunning-Kruger effect is very real, so the person who knows less about transformers than you is going to vote. We want everyone's opinion, no matter confidence. \ud83d\udc4d if you think at least one frontier model* will have no O(n^2) attention by the end of 2026 \ud83d\udd25 If you disagree * Frontier models - models that match / outperform the flagship claude, gemini or chatgpt at the time on multiple popular benchmarks See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/marksverdhei/554043140037847", "date_published": "2026-02-09T10:06:56.846242"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/464155376106577", "image": "", "title": "I just pushed Claude Code Agent Swarm with 20 coding agents on my desktop GPU workstation.", "content_text": "I just pushed Claude Code Agent Swarm with 20 coding agents on my desktop GPU workstation.

Not as a demo. Not as AutoML. But as an evolving system that designs and improves its own models. On two GPU types: \u2013 IT21HMDB01-B2: +30% prediction accuracy \u2013 H800: +25% prediction accuracy The resulting models already meet production standards and are being wired into the ops pipeline. How it works: \u2022 An ML agent designs the full ML pipeline from scratch \u2022 A Math agent performs targeted evolutionary optimization \u2022 The agents explore, discard, and iterate toward better modelsHumans don\u2019t hand-tune parameters. This is not offline analysis. GPU failure prediction means: \u2022 heavy assets \u2022 real incidents \u2022 real operational risk The agents now trigger maintenance before failures happen.

High-quality, open-source training data. We are honored that the author chose the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset to provide the crucial data foundation. Our dataset delivered the volume and structure needed to successfully teach a state-of-the-art model how to perform a critical privacy function.
