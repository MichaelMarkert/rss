First, I've created a dataset with Wikipedia's \"Cat\" article text in 272 languages: Norod78/WikiCat-Multilingual For each language entry with at least 100 words, I tokenized the text using 12 tokenizers and calculated the \"Characters per token\" ratio and \"Word per token\" ratio. The higher this ratio is, the more information each token represents on average for that language (and perhaps allowing the llm to potentially learn more per-parameter if trained on a dataset of that language). You can see a slideshow summary of the results here: https://norod.github.io/wikicat-tokenizer-eval/tokenizer-slideshow.html I hope I interpreted the results correctly, I've made the code available on GitHub so you can re-create the raw results jsonl with this repo: https://github.com/Norod/wikicat-tokenizer-eval Post on X: https://x.com/Norod78/status/1984366900550266999 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Norod78/977626760436669", "date_published": "2025-11-03T13:34:08.614805"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/468043722468280", "image": "", "title": "11 Fascinating new Policy Optimization techniques", "content_text": "11 Fascinating new Policy Optimization techniques Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are central to training AI models with preference-based feedback. In recent weeks, numerous new PO methods have emerged that build on or replace the popular PPO and GRPO, solving their issues. Here are 11 of them: 1. BAlanced Policy Optimization (BAPO) \u2192 BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (2510.18927) Dynamically adjusting the clipping bounds in PPO-style updates to balance positive and negative gradients and prevent entropy collapse 2. Training-Free GRPO \u2192 Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (2510.08191) Instead of using numeric rewards, it compares rollouts semantically to distill useful knowledge as a token prior, which is then applied during inference to guide the model\u2019s behavior 3.

The first dataset, poetic-imagery-small is designed to give the model's responses a bit of \"depth\" to them in order to encourage curiosity and thought from the user. Additionally, the excitement-small dataset is designed to teach the model how to use \"excited\" language conversationally. This dataset was used on both Apollo Astralis models, which effectively demonstrate general excitement during user interaction. VANTA Research is an AI safety project which aims to research and develop language models aligned for all types of thinking. These datasets were created aligned with that mission, in addition to rigorous AI safety standards.
