What makes it special? At Hawky.ai we are started experimenting with Qwen3 recently for Analysis and Optimization. Unlike traditional tools that look at text, images, or audio separately, Qwen3-Omni analyzes everything together. It handles 119 languages, processes 40-minute audio sequences, and understands both images and videos\u2014all at once. The cool part? It's 2-3x faster than similar models thanks to its MoE architecture. Real applications I'm seeing: Ad Analysis: It scores video ads by combining visual elements, audio tone, and text\u2014giving 25% better CTR predictions than single-mode tools. Campaign Localization: Drop in one ad, get 10 localized versions with native voiceovers in under a minute. Perfect for testing across markets.

Probably, you have done it with minimising a KL divergence, and it somehow worked. Well, not that well, right? 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Your model tends to memorise! 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Your model might get the right answer, but its reasoning might be flawed. To fix those problems, we rethink distillation and process a new approach! A method that is based on constrained RL that comes with nice theoretical guarantees and excellent performance!
