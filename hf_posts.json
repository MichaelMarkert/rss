Here are my notes on it:", "content_text": "Kimi K2 tech report is full of gems as always. Here are my notes on it: > MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) > Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. > They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 \"first dense\" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992", "date_published": "2025-07-24T05:30:03.451116"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/439685097705510", "image": "", "title": "KAT-V1 \ud83d\udd25 a LLM that tackles overthinking by switching between reasoning and direct answers, by Kuaishou.", "content_text": "KAT-V1 \ud83d\udd25 a LLM that tackles overthinking by switching between reasoning and direct answers, by Kuaishou.

Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu \u2192 https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09223 Many recommend this 270-page book as a good resource to focus on fundamental concepts, such as pre-training, generative models, prompting, alignment, and inference 2.
