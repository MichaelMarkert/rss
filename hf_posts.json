This also means that you can follow the course if you're already familiar with one of these frameworks, and soak up some of the fundamental knowledge in earlier units. Hopefully, this makes the agents course as open to as many people as possible.

It\u2019s a deep CNN with 8 layers (5 convolutional + 3 fully connected), pioneering the use of ReLU activations for faster training, dropout for regularization, and GPU acceleration for large-scale learning. This moment marked the beginning of the deep learning revolution, inspiring architectures like VGG, ResNet, and modern transformers.

The main one is that we have designed a CUDA kernel to expand the Flash Attention by @ tridao with RPE biases and supports other PE such as RoPE, ALiBi or FIRE. The result kernel is 2 times faster than a SPDA implementation. We also use Triton kernels to optimize certain parts of the architecture, such as the cross-entropy and RMSNorm layer. The various kernels have been carefully built to be compatible with BF16 and torch.compile to go even faster and achieve efficient pretraining. All other optimizations are described in a \ud83d\udcdd subsequent blog post available on @ huggingface \ud83e\udd17: CATIE-AQ/FAT5-report .
