Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on \"1 million W200 GPUs,\" hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack.

I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don\u2019t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you\u2019re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It\u2019s not perfect yet \u2014 I\u2019ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it\u2019s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community \u2014 submit a PR or send feedback. It\u2019s just a beta of an experimental idea!
