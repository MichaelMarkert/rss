One feature Hugging Face could really benefit from is a contribution heatmap \u2014 a visual dashboard to track user engagement and contributions across models, datasets, and models over the year, similar to GitHub\u2019s contribution graph. Guess what, Clem Delangue mentioned idea about using HF API reference for it and we made it for use. If you are a Hugging Face user add this Space in your collection and it will give you all stats about your contributions and commits nearly same as GitHub.

When you open source a piece of software, users leave their feedbacks via issues or PRs. You can merge their feedbacks in semi real time, this creates a positive cycle. Then you have a community. LLMs don't have these nice micro steps. There are no hot fixes. Even a minor version bump is an endeavor. I'm quite confident my model is being used by teams somewhere. But until next launch, it's awfully quiet. I don't know the solution.

Why did you remove the \"Regen\" feature from the ZeroGPU feature? Is this an error or intended? I am now limited to 13 images per 24 hrs. Using my space. When I upgraded to Pro, it was exclusively for the 5x more usage and the faster regen. The reason I spend my hard earned money on your site was for this feature.
