This tutorial covers how to do LoRA training and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth training on Qwen Image models. It covers both the Qwen Image base model and the Qwen Image Edit Plus 2509 model. This tutorial is the product of 21 days of full R&D, costing over $800 in cloud services to find the best configurations for training. Furthermore, we have developed an amazing, ultra-easy-to-use Gradio app to use the legendary Kohya Musubi Tuner trainer with ease. You will be able to train locally on your Windows computer with GPUs with as little as 6 GB of VRAM for both LoRA and Fine-Tuning....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/857881021159484", "date_published": "2025-11-10T13:34:19.372388"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/750415743005221", "image": "", "title": "In November, with", "content_text": "In November, with Robonine are starting work on the next version of the SO ARM 102 manipulator. The version will be open source and agreed upon with @ therobotbuilder the creator of the original manipulator. We are planning to: - increase positioning accuracy by approximately 2x using Feetech STS 3250 motors - increase working payload from 200g to 300g - increase rigidity using parametric design optimization and stiffer plastic - increase length to 550 mm - increase folding angles - use ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 mounting standard for the gripper - use a parallel gripper in the default version - update the mounting plate for different camera types, M3 grid with 12.5 mm pitch - add table mounting standard 80x80 M8 The number of degrees of freedom and basic kinematics will remain the same. Are there other things missing for working with SO ARM 100? - Any standard inputs/outputs, for example? - Status indicators? - Perhaps some types of mounting for third-party grippers are more preferable? -...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/750415743005221", "date_published": "2025-11-10T13:34:19.372769"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/314473561569432", "image": "", "title": "Introducing Photo-Mate-v2, based on FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, for advanced image manipulation tasks.

You negotiate with it. The hardware absolutely delivers. Spoiler alert; there is exactly ONE configuration where vLLM + ROCm + Triton + PyTorch + Drivers + Ubuntu Kernel to work at the same time. Finding it required the patience of a saint Consumer AMD for AI inference is the ultimate \"budget warrior\" play, insane performance-per-euro, but you need hardcore technical skills that would make a senior sysadmin nod in quiet respect.

It controls how finely numbers are represented, approximating real-world values with formats like fixed-point and floating-point. A recent BF16 \u2192 FP16 study renewed attention to precision impact. Here are the main precision types used in AI, from full precision for training to ultra-low precision for inference: 1. FP32 (Float32): Standard full-precision float used in most training: 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 mantissa bits. Default for backward-compatible training and baseline numerical stability 2. FP16 (Float16) \u2192 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10947v6 Half-precision float. It balances accuracy and efficiency. 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 mantissa bits.
