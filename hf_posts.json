In this tutorial I have compared all these precision and quantization variants for both speed and quality. The results are pretty surprising. Moreover, we have developed and published NVFP4 model quant generator app and FP8 Scaled quant generator apps. The links of the apps are below if you want to use them. Furthermore, upgrading ComfyUI to CUDA 13 with properly compiled libraries is now very much recommended. We have observed some noticeable performance gains with CUDA 13.
