Thrilled to share insights from my recent interview with MIT Technology Review about the growing movement toward local LLMs and what it means for AI democratization. Read here: https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/17/1120391/how-to-run-an-llm-on-your-laptop/ \ud83e\udd14 Why this matters: When we use \"free\" online AI services, we're often the product. Our conversations become training data, our personal stories get \"cooked into\" models, and our privacy becomes a commodity. But there's an alternative path forward. \ud83d\udca1 The power shift is real: Local LLMs aren't just about privacy; they're about redistributing AI power away from a handful of tech giants. When individuals, organizations, and even entire nations can run their own models, we're democratizing access to AI capabilities. \ud83e\udd17 At Hugging Face, we're proud to be at the center of this transformation.
