With frameworks like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangChain. \ud83d\udd17 Follow the org for updates https://huggingface.co/agents-course This week we are releasing the first framework unit in the course and it\u2019s on smolagents. This is what the unit covers: - why should you use smolagents vs another library? - how to build agents that use code - build multiagents systems - use vision language models for browser use The team has been working flat out on this for a few weeks. Led by @ sergiopaniego and supported by smolagents author @ m-ric .

Surprisingly, Lumina outperforms OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 in terms of alignment, although it ranks #6 in our overall human preference benchmark. To support further development in text-to-image models, we\u2019re making our entire human-annotated dataset publicly available.

Unlike traditional embedding models that directly match queries with documents, O1 Embedder first generates thoughtful reflections about the query before performing retrieval. This two-step process significantly improves performance on complex retrieval tasks, especially those requiring intensive reasoning or zero-shot generalization to new domains. The technical implementation is fascinating: - The model integrates two essential functions: Thinking and Embedding - It uses an \"Exploration-Refinement\" data synthesis workflow where initial thoughts are generated by an LLM and refined by a retrieval committee - A multi-task training method fine-tunes a pre-trained...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/419917039256941", "date_published": "2025-02-28T09:22:28.697546"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/116274779602090", "image": "", "title": "Necessity is mother of invention.

Open source olmOCR just dropped and the results are impressive. Tested the free demo with various documents, including a handwritten Claes Oldenburg letter. The speed is impressive: 3000 tokens/second on your own GPU - that's 1/32 the cost of GPT-4o ($190/million pages). Game-changer for content extraction and digital archives. To achieve this, Ai2 trained a 7B vision language model on 260K pages from 100K PDFs using \"document anchoring\" - combining PDF metadata with page images. Best part: it actually understands document structure (columns, tables, equations) instead of just jumbling everything together like most OCR tools. Their human eval results back this up. \ud83d\udc49 Try the demo: https://olmocr.allenai.org Going right into the AI toolkit: JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/636972739498133", "date_published": "2025-02-28T09:22:28.698634"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/390800785751051", "image": "", "title": "\ud83c\udf89 Exciting news, everyone!
