The results did not meet expectations. Veo2 struggled with style consistency and temporal coherence, falling behind competitors like Runway, Pika, Tencent, and even Alibaba. While the model shows promise, its alignment and quality are not yet there. Google recently launched Veo2, its latest text-to-video model, through select partners like fal.ai. As part of our ongoing evaluation of state-of-the-art generative video models, we rigorously benchmarked Veo2 against industry leaders. We generated a large set of Veo2 videos spending hundreds of dollars in the process and systematically evaluated them using our Python-based API for human and automated labeling.

Reading the tech report, and this section was really interesting to me from a methods/scientific fairness pov. Instead of doing over-hyped comparisons, they clearly state that **results are reported in a setup which is advantageous to their models**. (Which everybody does, but people usually don't say) For a tech report, it makes a lot of sense to report model performance when used optimally! On leaderboards on the other hand, comparison will be apples to apples, but in a potentially unoptimal way for a given model family (like some user interact sub-optimally with models) Also contains a cool section (6) on training data memorization rate too! Important to see if your model will output the training data it has seen as such: always an issue for privacy/copyright/... but also very much for evaluation! Because if your model knows its evals by heart, you're not testing for generalization.
