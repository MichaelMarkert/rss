These taxonomies break down jobs into tasks and skills, but they were built in a world before most work became digital-first, and long before generative AI could create marketing campaigns, voiceovers, or even whole professions in one step. That leaves us with a mismatch: we\u2019re trying to measure the future of work with tools from the past. With @ yjernite we describe why these frameworks are falling increasingly short in the age of generative AI. We argue that instead of discarding taxonomies, we need to adapt them. Imagine taxonomies that: \u2728 Capture new AI-native tasks and hybrid human-AI workflows \u2728 Evolve dynamically as technology shifts \u2728 Give workers a voice in deciding what gets automated and what stays human If we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll keep measuring the wrong things.

After doing almost one week of research, I have determined the very best presets and prepared this tutorial. With literally one click you will be able to install, download models, set presets, and use these amazing models. Wan 2.2 is currently the king of video generation models and now it is super fast with lightx2v Wan2.2-Lightning LoRAs. Moreover, Qwen Image is now ultra-fast with the recently released 8-step LoRA with almost no quality loss.
