Answering questions like, \u2018what is a reward?\u2019 and \u2018how do we create an environment for a language model?\u2019 - Then it focuses on Deepseek R1 by walking through the paper and highlighting key aspects. This is an old school way to learn ML topics, but it always works. - Next, it takes to you Transformers Reinforcement Learning and demonstrates potential reward functions you could use. This is cool because it uses Marimo notebooks to visualise the reward. - Finally, Maxime walks us through a real training notebook that uses GRPO to reduce generation length. I\u2019m really into this because it works and Maxime took the time to validate it share assets and logging from his own runs for you to compare with....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/281561952705692", "date_published": "2025-03-07T09:22:26.278884"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/198644025808355", "image": "", "title": "AI will bring us \"a country of yes-men on servers\" instead of one of \"Einsteins sitting in a data center\" if we continue on current trends.", "content_text": "AI will bring us \"a country of yes-men on servers\" instead of one of \"Einsteins sitting in a data center\" if we continue on current trends.
