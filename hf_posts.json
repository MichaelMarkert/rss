FLOW : https://labs.google/flow/about Veo 3 is Google DeepMind\u2019s most advanced video generation model to date. It allows users to create high-quality, cinematic video clips from simple text prompts, making it one of the most powerful AI tools for video creation. What sets Veo 3 apart is its ability to generate videos with native audio. This means that along with stunning visuals, Veo 3 can produce synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music\u2014all from a single prompt.

Primarily because I don't get motivation from sharing art publicly. I see so much new art daily online that once I begin thinking about where I fit in the mental fatigue becomes counter productive for me. Recently I shared an album of hundreds of creations with a friend (and singular art fan) and he asked some questions that I felt were interesting enough to create this post on my process and what it teaches me vs what I am seeking. Specifically I have learned to take ink drawings and create renderings that reveal my actual intention. My digital art goal is to recreate natural details into characters and landscapes that are imagined and deal with my affection for abstraction, deconstruction and humor. My drawing goals are to be humorous and crafty about how things can be rendered just slightly incorrect to make the viewer see something familiar and recognizable even when its nonsense.
