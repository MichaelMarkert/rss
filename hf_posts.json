In this tutorial, I will explain how to setup Z-Image Turbo model properly in your local PC with SwarmUI and download models and use them with highest quality via ready presets. Moreover, I will show to install Z-Image Turbo Fun Controlnet Union to generate amazing quality images with ControlNet preprocessors. Furthermore, I will show how to 1-click install AI Toolkit from Ostris and train Z-Image Turbo model LoRAs with highest quality configs made for every GPU like 8 GB GPUs, 12 GB GPUs, 24 GB GPUs and so on.
