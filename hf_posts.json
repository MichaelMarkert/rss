Just finished training my multimodal model on the full LLaVA-Instruct-150K dataset (157K samples) and wanted to share the results! \ud83d\udd27 What I Built: A vision-language model that can understand images and answer questions about them, combining: - Google Gemma-3-270M (language) - OpenAI CLIP ViT-Large/14 (vision) - LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency \ud83d\udcca Training Stats: - 157,712 training samples (full LLaVA dataset) - 3 epochs on A100 40GB - ~9 hours training time - Final loss: 1.333 training / 1.430 validation - Only 18.6M trainable params (3.4% of 539M total) \ud83d\udcc8 sagar007/multigemma Benchmark Results: - VQA Accuracy: 53.8% - Works great for: animal detection, room identification, scene understanding \ud83d\udd17 **Try it yourself:** - \ud83e\udd17 Model: sagar007/multigemma - \ud83c\udfae Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagar007/Multimodal-Gemma - \ud83d\udcbb GitHub: https://github.com/sagar431/multimodal-gemma-270m Built with PyTorch Lightning + MLflow...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/sagar007/387080486731099", "date_published": "2026-01-20T09:37:59.587428"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/425042812655046", "image": "", "title": "Compared Quality and Speed Difference (with CUDA 13 & Sage Attention) of BF16 vs GGUF Q8 vs FP8 Scaled vs NVFP4 for Z Image Turbo, FLUX Dev, FLUX SRPO, FLUX Kontext, FLUX 2 - Full 4K step by step tutorial also published", "content_text": "Compared Quality and Speed Difference (with CUDA 13 & Sage Attention) of BF16 vs GGUF Q8 vs FP8 Scaled vs NVFP4 for Z Image Turbo, FLUX Dev, FLUX SRPO, FLUX Kontext, FLUX 2 - Full 4K step by step tutorial also published Full 4K tutorial : https://youtu.be/XDzspWgnzxI Check above full 4K tutorial to learn more and see uncompressed original quality and size images It was always wondered how much quality and speed difference exists between BF16, GGUF, FP8 Scaled and NVFP4 precisions. In this tutorial I have compared all these precision and quantization variants for both speed and quality. The results are pretty surprising. Moreover, we have developed and published NVFP4 model quant generator app and FP8 Scaled quant generator apps. The links of the apps are below if you want to use them. Furthermore, upgrading ComfyUI to CUDA 13 with properly compiled libraries is now very much recommended. We have observed some noticeable performance gains with CUDA 13.
