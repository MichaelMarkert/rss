I have done over 64 different unique Wan 2.2 trainings to prepare the very best working training configurations for you. The configurations are fully working locally with as low as 6 GB GPUs. So you will be able to train your awesome Wan 2.2 image or video generation LoRAs on your Windows computer with easiness. Moreover, I have shown how to train on cloud platforms RunPod and Massed Compute so even if you have no GPU or you want faster training, you can train on cloud for very cheap prices fully privately.

Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314", "date_published": "2025-12-24T17:21:36.984141"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/davidmezzetti/102092244732124", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\uddec\u2695\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2c Encoding the World's Medical Knowledge into 970K!

They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.
