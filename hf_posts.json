I made this whilst prepping the next unit of the reasoning course: In this notebooks I combine together google\u2019s model with some community tooling - First, I load the model from the Hugging Face hub with transformers\u2019s latest release for Gemma 3 - I use PEFT and bitsandbytes to get it running on Colab - Then, I took Will Browns processing and reward functions to make reasoning chains from GSM8k - Finally, I used TRL\u2019s GRPOTrainer to train the model Next step is to bring Unsloth AI in, then ship it in the reasoning course.

Basically, everyone outside the bubble realized you can get a model for free\u2014and it\u2019s just as good as the paid ones.\" 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Product innovation is being democratized: Take Manus, for example\u2014they built a product on top of Anthropic\u2019s models that\u2019s \"actually better than...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/783485212316889", "date_published": "2025-03-14T17:16:21.139279"}]}
