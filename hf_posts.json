But what does it actually mean when an LLM is \u201cthinking\u201d? Imagine a chess player pausing before their next move not because they don\u2019t know how to play, but because they\u2019re running through possibilities, weighing options, and choosing the best one. LLMs do something similar\u2026 except they\u2019re not really thinking like us. Here\u2019s the surprising part :- You might think these reasoning skills come from futuristic architectures or alien neural networks. In reality, most reasoning LLMs still use the same transformer decoder-only architecture as other models The real magic? It\u2019s in how they\u2019re trained and what data they learn from. Can AI actually think, or is it just insanely good at faking it? I broke it down in a simple, 4-minute Medium read.

These taxonomies break down jobs into tasks and skills, but they were built in a world before most work became digital-first, and long before generative AI could create marketing campaigns, voiceovers, or even whole professions in one step. That leaves us with a mismatch: we\u2019re trying to measure the future of work with tools from the past. With @ yjernite we describe why these frameworks are falling increasingly short in the age of generative AI. We argue that instead of discarding taxonomies, we need to adapt them. Imagine taxonomies that: \u2728 Capture new AI-native tasks and hybrid human-AI workflows \u2728 Evolve dynamically as technology shifts \u2728 Give workers a voice in deciding what gets automated and what stays human If we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll keep measuring the wrong things.
