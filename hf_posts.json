So I spent some time to do a researching which platform I could buy or build. My requirements ware: - Limited budget - Power supply 1 kW or higher - Few PCIe slots to be able to install more than one gpu - Zero maintenance cost, I don't want spend a lot of time or money to maintain lab hardware, except for the GPUs I chose the Intel Mac Pro 7.1: - Prices on eBay acceptable - Excelent cooling - 1.4 kW power supply - 7 PCIe slots - Zero maintenance: I don't need to do anything with the Mac Pro hardware; it just works - Classic UEFI boot loader It requires a bit of OS preparation: 1. Install Ubuntu 24.04 (it works with the general PC ISO image) 2. Set up T2 drivers sudo apt install -y dkms linux-headers-$( uname -r) applesmc-t2 apple-bce lm-sensors 3.

Most models are Heretic'ed (uncensored) first, and tuned second. This vastly improves the model.

We trained this on ~10B tokens on a single AMD GPU (ROCm). It is not a Transformer: Echo-DSRN (400M) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by Hymba, RWKV, and xLSTM, designed to challenge the \"Attention is All You Need\" monopoly on the Edge.
