Maybe someone will find it useful? It's also because I want to get into the habit of writing, but had no motivation to do so. Maybe writing short informal posts will help build the habit. Since I don't have a personal site, and don't plan to create one in the near future, I think HF posts are best suited for short and informal documentation to share my little discoveries and learnings. If you're interested, strap in! First post in this series will be on basic study of Pytorch's float32 matmuls and their Triton implementation (nothing much, just the tutorial...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283", "date_published": "2025-06-14T17:18:58.723645"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/842061188959684", "image": "", "title": "this repo is gold! a collection of LLM apps with multi-agents, MCP, RAG and so much more.", "content_text": "this repo is gold! a collection of LLM apps with multi-agents, MCP, RAG and so much more. the best way to learn is by building, and this repo provides the blueprint.

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/\u03b5\u00b2) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, \u03b5 = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/\u03b5) examples (where d = input...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125", "date_published": "2025-06-14T17:18:58.725547"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/709852031491261", "image": "", "title": "New diffusion model for text-to-image and video-to-world generation: Cosmos Predict-2 \ud83d\udc7d", "content_text": "New diffusion model for text-to-image and video-to-world generation: Cosmos Predict-2 \ud83d\udc7d Model collection: nvidia/cosmos-predict2-68028efc052239369a0f2959 Diffusers support: https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11695 Documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/cosmos These are results with the 2B param model.
