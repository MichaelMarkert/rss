It was one of the first cases where the future of generative media really hit us. Humans are incredibly good at recognizing and analyzing faces, so they are a very good litmus test for any generative image model. But none of the current benchmarks measure the ability of models to generate humans independently. So we built our own. We measure the models ability to generate a diverse set of human faces and using over 20'000 human annotations we ranked all of the major models on their ability to generate faces. Find the full ranking here: https://app.rapidata.ai/mri/benchmarks/68af24ae74482280b62f7596 We have release the full underlying data publicly here on huggingface: Rapidata/Face_Generation_Benchmark See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/614528339803376", "date_published": "2025-11-11T17:22:03.677685"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/707388483660581", "image": "", "title": "7+ Main precision formats used in AI:", "content_text": "7+ Main precision formats used in AI: Precision is very important in AI as it shapes how accurate and efficient models are. It controls how finely numbers are represented, approximating real-world values with formats like fixed-point and floating-point. A recent BF16 \u2192 FP16 study renewed attention to precision impact. Here are the main precision types used in AI, from full precision for training to ultra-low precision for inference: 1. FP32 (Float32): Standard full-precision float used in most training: 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 mantissa bits. Default for backward-compatible training and baseline numerical stability 2. FP16 (Float16) \u2192 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10947v6 Half-precision float. It balances accuracy and efficiency. 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 mantissa bits. Common on NVIDIA Tensor Cores and mixed-precision setups. There\u2019s now a new wave of using it in reinforcement learning: https://www.turingpost.com/p/fp16 3.

We're releasing a collection of several carefully curated 1B token dataset samples specifically designed for rapid prototyping and pretraining experiments: https://huggingface.co/collections/codelion/pre-training-dataset-samples These samples were created using reservoir sampling - an algorithm that guarantees statistically unbiased random samples from massive source datasets. This means results you get at the 1B token scale are representative of how these datasets behave at 100B+ token scales, letting you iterate quickly without the computational overhead.

It extends the Hugging Face Transformers interface with TPU-aware features such as automatic sharding, custom attention kernels, and quantization-aware loading, making large-scale deployment and training both simpler and faster. With quantization and Splash Attention kernels, AutoXLA achieves up to 4\u00d7 speedups over standard Flash Attention implementations, significantly improving throughput for both inference and training workloads. Whether you\u2019re experimenting with distributed setups (FSDP, 2D, or 3D sharding) or optimizing memory via LanguageModelQuantizer, AutoXLA is built to make scaling LLMs on TPU seamless. \u26a0\ufe0f Note: This is an experimental repository.
