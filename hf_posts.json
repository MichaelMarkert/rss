He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference. As a thank you to the community, he shared 100 invite code first-come first serve, just use \u201cHUGGINGFACE\u201d to get access!

Incredible group to be part of - each person is doing groundbreaking work at the intersection of AI and journalism. Worth following them all: they're consistently sharing practical insights on building the future of news. Take the time to read this report, it's packed with insights as always. The news & information section's #1 insight hits hard: \"The most substantive economic impact of AI to date has been licensing payouts for a handful of big publishers. The competition will start shifting in the year ahead to separate AI 'haves' that have positioned themselves to grow from the 'have-nots.'\" This AI-driven divide is something I've been really concerned about.
