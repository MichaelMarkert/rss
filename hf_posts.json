Ai2 just released OLMoTrace and it's a game-changer for transparency. You can literally see where an AI's responses come from in its training data - in real time. The demo shows results about C\u00e9line. So I tried it out myself! Watch what happens in the video. For journalists, researchers studying hallucinations and anyone who needs to trust their AI, this is like getting X-ray vision into AI systems. When the model made claims, I could instantly verify them against original sources. When it hallucinated, I could see why. You can finally 1) understand how LLMs actually work and 2) verify if what they're saying is true. No more blind trust. This pushes the open data movement to the next level. \ud83d\udc49 Blog post: https://allenai.org/blog/olmotrace \ud83d\udc49 Paper: https://www.datocms-assets.com/64837/1743890415-olmotrace.pdf P.S.: A word of caution: never use a chatbot as a knowledge base.

CPU can't replace GPU.", "content_text": "We desperately need GPU for model inference. CPU can't replace GPU. I will start with the basics. GPU is designed to serve predictable workloads with many parallel units (pixels, tensors, tokens). So a GPU allocates as much transistor budget as possible to build thousands of compute units (Cuda cores in NVidia or execution units in Apple Silicon), each capable of running a thread. But CPU is designed to handle all kinds of workloads. CPU cores are much larger (hence a lot fewer) with branch prediction and other complex things. In addition, more and more transistors are allocated to build larger cache (~50% now) to house the unpredictable, devouring the compute budget. Generalists can't beat specialists.
