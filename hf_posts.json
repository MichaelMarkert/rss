What if you then linked those entities to each other and visualized it as a network? This is the result of enriching all 241 pages and 111,267 words of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) with Kanon 2 Enricher in less than ten seconds at the cost of 47 cents. Dred Scott v. Sandford is the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision by far, and has variously been called \"the worst Supreme Court decision ever\" and \"the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound\" due to its denial of the rights of African Americans. Thanks to Kanon 2 Enricher, we now also know that the case contains 950 numbered paragraphs, 6 footnotes, 178 people mentioned 1,340 times, 99 locations mentioned 1,294 times, and 298 external documents referenced 940 times. For an American case, there are a decent number of references to British precedents (27 to be exact), including the Magna Carta (\u00b6 928)....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/642764051817350", "date_published": "2026-02-14T13:48:28.427599"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/EricFillion/822659161925864", "image": "", "title": "Run open-source models with up to 120B parameters locally on your Mac!", "content_text": "Run open-source models with up to 120B parameters locally on your Mac! https://youtu.be/Ql4PDjoxNXQ?si=3yHpz51uinUjgyNh See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/EricFillion/822659161925864", "date_published": "2026-02-14T13:48:28.427840"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Janady07/979829700588468", "image": "", "title": "MEGAMIND Day Update: Four Weight Matrices.

Today, they are hallucinating beautifully. 10 years ago, getting an LSTM to output coherent English was a struggle. 10 years later, after a \"cure\" based on FineWeb-EDU and a custom synthetic mix for causal conversation, the results are fascinating. We trained this on ~10B tokens on a single AMD GPU (ROCm). It is not a Transformer: Echo-DSRN (400M) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by Hymba, RWKV, and xLSTM, designed to challenge the \"Attention is All You Need\" monopoly on the Edge.
