This tutorial covers how to do LoRA training and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth training on Qwen Image models. It covers both the Qwen Image base model and the Qwen Image Edit Plus 2509 model. This tutorial is the product of 21 days of full R&D, costing over $800 in cloud services to find the best configurations for training. Furthermore, we have developed an amazing, ultra-easy-to-use Gradio app to use the legendary Kohya Musubi Tuner trainer with ease.

Precision and Repeatability: - Repeatability tolerance: \u00b10.02 mm at the end of a 95 mm arm - Smooth motion response with PID control and 12-bit (4096-step) magnetic encoder - Reliable performance for high-accuracy robotics and automation applications #Feetech #STS3250 #ServoTest #Robotics #Engineering #PrecisionControl #HardwareReview See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/935466322450846", "date_published": "2025-11-09T09:21:03.451450"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/750415743005221", "image": "", "title": "In November, with", "content_text": "In November, with Robonine are starting work on the next version of the SO ARM 102 manipulator.
