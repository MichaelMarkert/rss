Stories of families torn apart, U.S. citizens detained for hours, people arrested just for speaking Spanish. This isn't the America I believe in. Instead of doom-scrolling, I spent a few days building FIREWATCH - a free civil rights protection app. What it does: \u2022 Real-time ICE raid alerts \u2022 Know Your Rights education in 10+ languages \u2022 Secure evidence recording \u2022 Emergency panic button \u2022 Legal hotlines and resources \u2022 100% private, no tracking The catch? There isn't one. You just need a free Google API key that stays on your device. Works completely offline. https://firewatch-ice.vercel.app/ I built this because everyone deserves constitutional protection. The 4th Amendment doesn't have an asterisk. If this helps one family stay safe, every sleepless night was worth it. Please share with anyone who needs it. Stay safe.

Original jokes are particularly hard for LLMs, as jokes are very nuanced and a lot of context is needed to understand if something is \"funny\". Something that can only reliably be measured using humans. LLMs are not equally good at generating jokes in every language. Generated English jokes turned out to be way funnier than the Japanese ones. 46% of English-speaking voters on average found the generated joke funny. The same statistic for other languages: Vietnamese: 44% Portuguese: 40% Arabic: 37% Japanese: 28% There is not much variance in generation quality among models for any fixed language.

Now, we're migrating the rest of the Hub https://huggingface.co/blog/migrating-the-hub-to-xet But how did we get here? In the early days of joining Hugging Face, we made a few key design decisions: * There would be no \"hard cut-over\" from Git LFS to Xet * A Xet-enabled repository should be able to contain both Xet and LFS files * Repository migrations from LFS to Xet can run in the background without disrupting downloads or uploads These were largely driven by our desire to ensure the community could keep working without interruption.

So\u2026 who are they, and why does it matter? Had a lot of fun co-writing this blog post with @ xianbao , with key insights translated from Chinese, to unpack how this startup built a model that outperforms GPT-4.1, Claude Opus, and DeepSeek V3 on several major benchmarks. \ud83e\uddf5 A few standout facts: 1. From zero to $3.3B in 18 months: Founded in March 2023, Moonshot is now backed by Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, and HongShan. 2. A CEO who thinks from the end: Yang Zhilin (31) previously worked at Meta AI, Google Brain, and Carnegie Mellon. His vision? Nothing less than AGI \u2014 still a rare ambition among Chinese AI labs. 3. A trillion-parameter model that\u2019s surprisingly efficient: Kimi K2 uses a mixture-of-experts architecture (32B active params per inference) and dominates on coding/math benchmarks. 4.
