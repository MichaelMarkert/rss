While we\u2019re not attending this year, we\u2019re closely following the updates and today we pull together a quick, easy-to-digest roundup of a few standout papers so you can jump in without getting overwhelmed. Here is a list of 15 papers from NeurIPS 2025, including 8 top research papers that received awards, along with 7 others that caught our attention: 1. Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks \u2192 https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/test-of-time/128328 Test of Time Award winner. Introduces the RPN, a small convnet that predicts objectness and boxes on shared features, enabling Faster R-CNN to share computation and run around 5 fps on a GPU 2.
