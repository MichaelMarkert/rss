Our 49-page report details Sailor2's development journey, including multilingual data cleaning, small model data mixture simulations, multi-stage continual pre-training, multi-stage post-training, and multi-cultural multi-lingual evaluations. Sailor2 aims to streamline the multilingual model pre-training process efficiently for the community. \ud83e\udded We highlight Sailor2's impressive performance in low-resource language translation scenarios and its cultural understanding advantages in Southeast Asia, promoting practical applications for regional languages. Model updates include: \ud83d\udca1 More precise outputs: Reduced redundancy in model outputs through refined post-training data and optimization techniques. \ud83c\udf08 Handling longer texts: Expanded to handle up to 128K context length in Southeast Asian languages through long-text training. \u26a1\ufe0f Faster inference: Achieved 2.5x faster inference...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dreamerdeo/426313569382827", "date_published": "2025-02-21T09:21:39.839154"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/138106605710984", "image": "", "title": "Integrating human feedback is vital for evolving AI models.
