Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -> Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! \ud83e\udde0 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480", "date_published": "2025-06-10T09:26:31.412548"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/946731855039439", "image": "", "title": "As part of Duality AI\u2019s recent Kaggle competition, we\u2019ve released a free, fully customizable cloud scenario designed to help you create targeted datasets with YOLO-compatible labels.", "content_text": "As part of Duality AI\u2019s recent Kaggle competition, we\u2019ve released a free, fully customizable cloud scenario designed to help you create targeted datasets with YOLO-compatible labels.
