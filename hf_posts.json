With the rapid advancement of AI agent technology, two architectures have come into the spotlight: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and MCO (Model Context Open-json). Today, we\u2019ll introduce the key features and differences of these two approaches. VIDraft/Agentic-AI-CHAT MCP: The Traditional Approach \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Centralized Function Registry: All functions are hardcoded into the core system. Static Function Definitions & Tight Coupling: New features require changes to the core application code, limiting scalability. Monolithic Design: Complex deployment and version management can cause a single error to affect the whole system. Code Example: '''py FUNCTION_REGISTRY = { \"existing_function\": existing_function, \"new_function\": new_function # Adding a new function } ''' MCO: A Revolutionary Approach \ud83c\udd95 JSON-based Function Definitions: Function details are stored in external JSON files, enabling dynamic module loading.

And it's so cool, because each new paper adds a trick to the toolbox, making LLMs more capable without needing to scale parameter count of the models. So here are 13 new methods + 3 comprehensive studies on test-time scaling: 1. Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling (2504.02495) Probably, the most popular study. It proposes to boost inference-time scalability by improving reward modeling. To enhance performance, DeepSeek-GRM uses adaptive critiques, parallel sampling, pointwise generative RM, and Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) 2. T1: Tool-integrated Self-verification for Test-time Compute Scaling in Small Language Models (2504.04718) Allows small models to use external tools, like code interpreters and calculator, to enhance self-verification 3.

Automating semantic links on websites using Large Language Models (LLMs) enhances user experience and efficiency. Here's a simplified workflow: 1. Store LLM embeddings in PostgreSQL: Use the vector data type to store text embeddings generated by an LLM. 2. Divide page texts into chunks for processing. 3. Generate embeddings using an LLM for each chunk of text. 4. Create template markup around specific terms needing links. An automated program then: - Converts marked-up terms to their corresponding LLMs' embeddings, - Compares these with stored database embeddings (using cosine similarity), - Identifies the most relevant page based on highest similarity score, and - Automatically adds a link from the original content to this contextually related information.
