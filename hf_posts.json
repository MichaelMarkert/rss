ScalingOpt is a professional platform focusing on optimization for large-scale deep learning, aiming to advocate for \"Optimization at Scale,\" which means verifiable and scalable optimization algorithms. This community platform is dedicated to gathering, discovering, comparing, and contributing various cutting-edge optimizers and optimization algorithms. It's not just a simple Awesome List, it also includes: Visualizations: Covers visualization scripts for the Rosenbrock Function and the Rastrigin Function for users to freely explore. Benchmark: We recommend Algoperf as the primary source, along with other verifiable benchmarks and analysis articles, for users to reference the best optimizer.

But what happens when you need to scale beyond that, where the bandwidth drops? That is where Pipeline Parallelism (PP) takes over. Instead of slicing the operation, PP slices the model depth. It turns your GPU cluster into an assembly line: GPU 0 handles layers 1-12, GPU 1 handles 13-24, and so on. The hardware challenge here isn't the interconnect speed\u2014it is the \"Pipeline Bubble.\" In a naive setup, expensive H100s sit idle for most of the cycle waiting for data to flow through the chain. My latest guide breaks down the scheduling strategies used to minimize this idle silicon time. In this deep dive, we cover: The Hardware Mechanics: Vertical Slicing Unlike TP which requires \"chatty\" All-Reduce operations, PP relies on lightweight Point-to-Point (Send/Recv) communication. This makes it the only viable strategy for crossing node boundaries over Ethernet or InfiniBand.
