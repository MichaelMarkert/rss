But what happens when an AI tells you \"I understand how you feel\" and you actually believe it? At Hugging Face, together with @ frimelle and @ yjernite , we dug into something we felt wasn't getting enough attention: the need to evaluate AI companionship behaviors. These are the subtle ways AI systems validate us, engage with us, and sometimes manipulate our emotional lives. Here's what we found: \ud83d\udc49 Existing benchmarks (accuracy, helpfulness, safety) completely miss this emotional dimension. \ud83d\udc49 We mapped how leading AI systems actually respond to vulnerable prompts. \ud83d\udc49 We built the Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA): a first attempt at evaluating how models handle emotional dependency, boundaries, and attachment (with a full paper coming soon).
