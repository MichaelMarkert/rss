Read here: https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/17/1120391/how-to-run-an-llm-on-your-laptop/ \ud83e\udd14 Why this matters: When we use \"free\" online AI services, we're often the product. Our conversations become training data, our personal stories get \"cooked into\" models, and our privacy becomes a commodity. But there's an alternative path forward. \ud83d\udca1 The power shift is real: Local LLMs aren't just about privacy; they're about redistributing AI power away from a handful of tech giants. When individuals, organizations, and even entire nations can run their own models, we're democratizing access to AI capabilities. \ud83e\udd17 At Hugging Face, we're proud to be at the center of this transformation.

By combining it with visual grounding, we add contextual understanding so instead of detecting just \"vase\", we can detect \"middle vase\" in an image. VLMs are super powerful! In this case, I use PaliGemma 2 which already supports object detection and extend it to also add visual grounding. \ud83e\udd17 Check it out here: https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/fine_tuning_vlm_object_detection_grounding See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/300981041730206", "date_published": "2025-07-20T17:21:16.999308"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/685652769208143", "image": "", "title": "M2-Reasoning\ud83d\udd25 a unified multimodal model for general (math, logic) and spatial (motion, physics, orientation) reasoning, released by  AntGroup.", "content_text": "M2-Reasoning\ud83d\udd25 a unified multimodal model for general (math, logic) and spatial (motion, physics, orientation) reasoning, released by AntGroup.
