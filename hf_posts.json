Some of its directions are already showing huge promise, while others are still early but exciting. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s happening right now in RL: 1. Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) \u2192 Reinforcement Pre-Training (2506.08007) Reframes next-token pretraining as RL with verifiable rewards, yielding scalable reasoning gains 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2192 Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences (1706.03741) The top approach.

My co-author @ cgeorgiaw and I just published a paper challenging a core assumption: that the main barriers to AI in science are technical. They're not. They're social. Key findings: \ud83d\udea8 The \"AI Scientist\" myth delays progress: Waiting for AGI devalues human expertise and obscures science's real purpose: cultivating understanding, not just outputs. \ud83d\udcca Wrong incentives: Datasets have 100x longer impact than models, yet data curation is undervalued. \u26a0\ufe0f Broken collaboration: Domain scientists want understanding. ML researchers optimize performance. Without shared language, projects fail. \ud83d\udd0d Fragmentation costs years: Harmonizing just 9 cancer files took 329 hours.

I would be grateful if you could check it and upvote on HuggingFace Daily Papers - Reactive Transformer (RxT) -- Stateful Real-Time Processing for Event-Driven Reactive Language Models (2510.03561) Architecture is based on stateful real-time processing with innovational asynchronous memory update. Instead of reprocessing all the conversation history for each message, it's processing only single query with all the context moved to dedicated memory layers. Memory is updated after generating the answer, so it's not influencing latency - in tests, time to first token was almost the same as generating a single token. It has also better quality/accuracy in multi-turn dialogue than the same size stateless decoder-only model.
