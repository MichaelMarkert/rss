My digital art goal is to recreate natural details into characters and landscapes that are imagined and deal with my affection for abstraction, deconstruction and humor. My drawing goals are to be humorous and crafty about how things can be rendered just slightly incorrect to make the viewer see something familiar and recognizable even when its nonsense.
