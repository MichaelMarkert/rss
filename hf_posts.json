The results did not meet expectations. Veo2 struggled with style consistency and temporal coherence, falling behind competitors like Runway, Pika, Tencent, and even Alibaba. While the model shows promise, its alignment and quality are not yet there. Google recently launched Veo2, its latest text-to-video model, through select partners like fal.ai. As part of our ongoing evaluation of state-of-the-art generative video models, we rigorously benchmarked Veo2 against industry leaders. We generated a large set of Veo2 videos spending hundreds of dollars in the process and systematically evaluated them using our Python-based API for human and automated labeling.
