This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -> CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -> Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns.

One trend that has captured the attention of many is Explainable AI. As the name suggests, this revolutionary technology aims to provide a clear, understandable explanation for the decisions and actions taken by AI systems. In the future, Explainable AI is expected to become even more sophisticated, with advanced algorithms and techniques being developed to better interpret and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by AI systems. This will not only make AI systems more reliable and trustworthy, but it will also help to demystify the world of AI, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

I was hoping somebody would be willing to check out this thought experiment of mine with the aim to reduce tokens in inter-agent communications. How It Works: 1. You provide a task in natural language (NL) 2. NL-to-CCL Agent: Converts your request into a structured Compressed Communication Language (CCL) task. 3. Inter-agent communication occurs in CCL 4. CCL is translated back to NL before being presented to the user. I have a notebook with an example that claims to achieve these results: --- Token Usage Summary --- Total NL Tokens (User Input & Final Output): 364 Total CCL Tokens (for NL/CCL Conversions): 159 Total CCL Tokens (Internal Agent Communication): 194 Overall token savings on NL-to-CCL conversion portions: 56.32% ------------------------ When asking Gemini it concludes: \"Yes, the methods used in this notebook are sensible.
