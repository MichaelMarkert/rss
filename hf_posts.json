Every byte downloaded comes through our infrastructure. Using Xet on Hugging Face is the fastest way to download and iterate on open source models and we've proved it with Llama 4 giving a boost of ~25% across all models. We expect builders on the Hub to see even more improvements, helping power innovation across the community. With the models on our infrastructure, we can peer in and see how well our dedupe performs across the Llama 4 family. On average, we're seeing ~25% dedupe, providing huge savings to the community who iterate on these state-of-the-art models. The attached image shows a few selected models and how they perform on Xet.

It encompasses a wide range of approaches with different computational methods and deployment. Firstly, here are 5 inference types, based on how the model reasons: 1. Probabilistic inference -> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05244 Uses probability theory to reason under uncertainty. The system maintains degrees of belief over hypotheses and updates them as evidence comes in. 2. Rule-based inference -> Logicbreaks: A Framework for Understanding Subversion of Rule-based Inference (2407.00075) Draws conclusions by applying explicit if-then rules encoded in a knowledge base. Mostly used in neurosymbolic AI. 3. Logical inference -> https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03393 Uses formal logic to draw conclusions that are guaranteed true if the premises are. It supports theorem proving, logic programming, and tasks needing correctness,...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/801521718111431", "date_published": "2025-04-08T09:25:40.940851"}]}
