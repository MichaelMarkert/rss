But what happens when an AI tells you \"I understand how you feel\" and you actually believe it? At Hugging Face, together with @ frimelle and @ yjernite , we dug into something we felt wasn't getting enough attention: the need to evaluate AI companionship behaviors. These are the subtle ways AI systems validate us, engage with us, and sometimes manipulate our emotional lives. Here's what we found: \ud83d\udc49 Existing benchmarks (accuracy, helpfulness, safety) completely miss this emotional dimension. \ud83d\udc49 We mapped how leading AI systems actually respond to vulnerable prompts. \ud83d\udc49 We built the Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA): a first attempt at evaluating how models handle emotional dependency, boundaries, and attachment (with a full paper coming soon).

AI's all about the data! \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcda) The impact of the template will depend on how effectively it establishes a minimum meaningful transparency standard for companies that don't otherwise offer any transparency into their handling of e.g. personal data or (anti?-)competitive practices in commercial licensing - we'll see how those play out as new models are released after August 2nd \ud83d\udc40 In the meantime, I wanted to see how the template works for a fully open-source + commercially viable model, so I filled it out for the SmolLM3 - which my colleagues at Hugging Face earlier this month \ud83e\udd17 ICYMI, it's fully open-source with 3B parameters and performance matching the best similar-size models (I've switched all my local apps from Qwen3 to it, you should...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/544574162514620", "date_published": "2025-07-30T13:43:41.209269"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/smirki/773357866668514", "image": "", "title": "Just dropped!", "content_text": "Just dropped!

Today, we're highlighting crucial research that does just that by exposing a new vulnerability. The paper \"Forget to Flourish\" details a new model poisoning technique. It's a reminder that as we fine-tune LLMs, our anonymization and privacy strategies must evolve to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy dataset was instrumental in this study. It served two key purposes: Provided a Realistic Testbed: It gave the researchers access to a diverse set of synthetic and realistic PII samples in a safe, controlled environment. Enabled Impactful Benchmarking: It allowed them to measure the actual effectiveness of their data extraction attack, proving it could compromise specific, high-value information.
