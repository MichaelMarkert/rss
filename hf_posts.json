For any AI agent, internet search \ud83d\udd0e is an important tool. However, with APIs like Tavily and Exa, it becomes really difficult to keep up with the cost. In some cases, these Internet APIs cost more than the LLM. To solve, this, I am making a playwright wrapper API on top of publicly available searXNG instances. This will enable agent applications to fetch internet results for free. Currently, I have set up a basic GitHub repo, and I will continue developing advanced search features, such as image search \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Github: https://github.com/HanzlaJavaid/Free-Search/tree/main \ud83d\ude80 Try the deployed version: https://freesearch.replit.app/docs If you find this useful, consider starring \u2b50\ufe0f the GitHub repository to support further development!
