If you don't already know, Gradio is an open-source Python library used to build interfaces for machine learning models. Beyond just creating UIs, Gradio also exposes API capabilities and now, Gradio apps can be launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for LLMs. If you already know how to use Gradio, there are only two additional things you need to do: * Add standard docstrings to your function (these will be used to generate the descriptions for your tools for the LLM) * Set mcp_server=True in launch() Here's a complete example (make sure you already have the latest version of Gradio installed): import gradio as gr def letter_counter ( word, letter ): \"\"\"Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word.

If you want to convert an existing Space, like this one hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS , so that you can use it with Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline / TinyAgents / or any LLM that supports MCP, here's all you need to do: 1. Duplicate the Space (in the Settings Tab) 2. Upgrade the Gradio sdk_version to 5.28 (in the README.md ) 3. Set mcp_server=True in launch() 4. (Optionally) add docstrings to the function so that the LLM knows how to use it, like this: def generate ( text, speed= 1 ): \"\"\" Convert text to speech audio.

A new benchmark called Phare, by Giskard, tested leading models across multiple languages, revealing three key findings: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Popular models aren't necessarily factual. Some models ranking highest in user satisfaction benchmarks like LMArena are actually more prone to hallucination. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 The way you ask matters - a lot. When users present claims confidently (\"My teacher said...\"), models are 15% less likely to correct misinformation vs. neutral framing (\"I heard...\"). 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Telling models to \"be concise\" can increase hallucination by up to 20%. What's also cool is that the full dataset is public - use them to test your own models or dive deeper into the results!

Over the past few months, I explored how to build intelligent, autonomous agents using cutting-edge tools like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. The course covered everything from the fundamentals of agents to advanced topics like fine-tuning for function-calling, observability, evaluation, and even agents in games. Some key content included: 1. Introduction to AI Agents 2. Agentic RAG use cases 3. Multi-framework implementation: smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph 4. Building, testing, and certifying a complete agent project This was a hands-on, practical experience that deepened my understanding of how to design reliable, tool-using LLM agents. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and beyond. Many thanks to the Hugging Face team for putting this together.
