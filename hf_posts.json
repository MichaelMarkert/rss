To stay up to date with what\u2019s happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. \"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\" by Nathan Lambert -> https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. \"A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)\" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -> https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It\u2019s packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3. \"Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning\" video course by Shiyu Zhao -> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhdbSEZZbDaFWPX4gehhwB9vJZJ1DNm8 Offers a mathematical...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/484268922176188", "date_published": "2025-04-29T05:22:46.921810"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/653065305581211", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Building Better Evaluations: 32K Image Annotations Now Available", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 Building Better Evaluations: 32K Image Annotations Now Available Today, we're releasing an expanded version: 32K images annotated with 3.7M responses from over 300K individuals which was completed in under two weeks using the Rapidata Python API. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback-32k A few months ago, we published one of our most liked dataset with 13K images based on the @ data-is-better-together 's dataset, following Google's research on \"Rich Human Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation\" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10240 ). It collected over 1.5M responses from 150K+ participants. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback In the examples below, users highlighted words from prompts that were not correctly depicted in the generated images. Higher word scores indicate more frequent issues. If an image captured the prompt accurately, users could select [No_mistakes].
