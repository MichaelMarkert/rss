Not much sleep, but lots of progress! So I managed to build the first MVP version of my custom Gradio component, azettl/gradio_consilium_roundtable ( https://pypi.org/project/gradio-consilium-roundtable/ ). This creates a visual roundtable component for AI consensus discussions. Displays AI participants as avatars positioned around an oval table (poker style!) with animated speech bubbles, thinking states, and real-time discussion updates. Also, I managed to get a rough draft of the Gradio app + MCP server done, but not so much yet that I can share the space with you. You will be able to define your question the AI participants should discuss, decide on the protocol, do role assignments like having a devil's advocate on the table, and define the communication pattern. Lastly, you can decide which AI should be the moderator and how...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/azettl/397733899741459", "date_published": "2025-06-04T17:21:55.381506"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\udde0 We just implemented Andrej Karpathy's \"third paradigm\" for LLM learning!", "content_text": "\ud83e\udde0 We just implemented Andrej Karpathy's \"third paradigm\" for LLM learning! System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. \ud83d\ude80 How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. \ud83d\udcca Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% \u2192 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% \u2192 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% \u2192 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. \u2728 Key benefits: \ud83d\udd04 Cumulative learning over time \ud83d\udcd6 Transparent, inspectable strategies \ud83d\udd0c Works with any OpenAI-compatible API \u26a1 Simple integration: just add \"spl-\" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm.
