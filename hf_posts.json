Then came the myth that AI was too dangerous to share, and companies started optimizing for short-term revenue. That led many major AI labs and researchers to stop sharing and collaborating. With OAI and sama now saying they're willing to share open weights again, we have a real chance to return to a golden age of AI progress and democratization\u2014powered by openness and collaboration, in the US and around the world.

The focus is on Enterprise LLMs. LLMs with Billions of Parameters: Most of the LLMs still fall in that category. The first ones (ChatGPT) appeared around 2022, though Bert is an early precursor. Most recent books discussing LLMs still define them as transformer architecture with deep neural networks (DNNs), costly training, and reliance on GPUs. The training is optimized to predict the next tokens or missing tokens. However, this task is remotely relevant to what modern LLMs now deliver to the user, see here. Yet it requires time and intensive computer resources. Indeed, this type of architecture works best with billions or trillions of tokens. In the end, most of these tokens are noise, requiring smart distillation for performance improvement.
