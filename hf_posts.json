With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -> https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -> https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3.
