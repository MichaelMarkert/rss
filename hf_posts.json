My favorite new feature? \ud83e\udd14 The new dynamic weight loader + converter. Here\u2019s why \ud83d\udc47 Over the last few months, the core Transformers maintainers built an incredibly fast weight loader, capable of converting tensors on the fly while loading them in parallel threads. This means we\u2019re no longer constrained by how parameters are laid out inside the safetensors weight files. In practice, this unlocks two big things: - Much more modular modeling code. You can now clearly see how architectures build on top of each other (DeepSeek v2 \u2192 v3, Qwen v2 \u2192 v3 \u2192 MoE, etc.). This makes shared bottlenecks obvious and lets us optimize the right building blocks once, for all model families. - Performance optimizations beyond what torch.compile can do alone. torch.compile operates on the computation graph, but it can\u2019t change...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/848772925772411", "date_published": "2026-01-28T17:36:23.867587"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ovi054/176731931119322", "image": "", "title": "ovi054/LTX-2-19b-Squish-LoRA", "content_text": "ovi054/LTX-2-19b-Squish-LoRA \u26a1 I trained a Squish LoRA for LTX-2.
