This work was part of a paper we published to ICCR Kyoto 2025. Check out or code here: https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot/tree/main Our work aims to solve two key problems in the world of robotic manipulation: 1. The lack of a well-developed, open-source, accessible teleoperation system that can work out of the box. 2. No performant end-to-end control, recording, and learning platform for robots that is completely hardware agnostic.
