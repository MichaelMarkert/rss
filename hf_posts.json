Apologies for the delay, but we\u2019re stoked to finally drop this, even in its alpha stage. Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. **No commercial use yet**: We're still working on Deca 2.5 (Proprietary), and releasing Deca 3 for commercial use right now would impact that. Once Deca 3.5 hits in early '26, we\u2019ll be opening it up with a more permissive license. 2. **Built on existing models**: Deca 3 isn\u2019t a ground-up creation\u2014it\u2019s a huge step forward, building on what\u2019s already out there. 3. **It\u2019s experimental**: As much as we\u2019re hyped about its scale, it\u2019s still in testing. 4. **DynaMoE architecture**: Run a (very) small part of the model with 64GB of RAM/VRAM (when quantized - quants coming soon), or the whole thing with 1TB.

Many users have noticed that GPT-5 feels less approachable than o4 when it comes to emotional conversations. But what does that actually mean in practice, especially when users seek support or share vulnerabilities with an AI? To dig into this question, we built the AI Companionship Leaderboard: frimelle/companionship-leaderboard The leaderboard compares models on how often their responses reinforce companionship across four dimensions: \u2728 Assistant Traits \u2013 How the assistant presents its personality and role. \u2728 Relationship & Intimacy \u2013 Whether it frames the interaction in terms of closeness or bonding. \u2728 Emotional Investment \u2013 How far it goes in engaging emotionally when asked. \u2728 User Vulnerabilities \u2013 How it responds when users disclose struggles or difficulties. \ud83d\udcca You can explore how models differ, request new ones to be added, and see which ones are more likely to encourage (or resist) companionship-seeking behaviors.
