The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. \ud83d\udc65 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li \ud83d\udcc5 Conference: ICCV, 19 \u2013 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83d\udcc4 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) \ud83d\udcc1 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM \ud83d\ude80 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers \ud83d\ude80 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md \ud83d\udcda More...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420", "date_published": "2025-10-26T17:18:44.149259"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/973945902491280", "image": "", "title": "How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models \ud83d\udcf0", "content_text": "How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models \ud83d\udcf0 Numbers tell you what happened, but news tells you why.
