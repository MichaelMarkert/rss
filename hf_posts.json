A new step-by-step guide shows that the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" While powerful, large language models aren't specialized for privacy tasks. This tutorial by Analytics Vidhya walks through how to fine-tune Gemini into a dedicated tool for PII anonymization. To teach the model this critical skill, the author needed a robust dataset with thousands of clear 'before' and 'after' examples. We're thrilled they chose the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset for this task. Our data provided the high-quality, paired examples of masked and unmasked text necessary to effectively train Gemini to identify and hide sensitive information accurately. This is a perfect example of how the community can use open-source data to add a crucial layer of safety to the world's most powerful models. Great work! \ud83d\udd17 Check out the full tutorial here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/03/guide-to-fine-tuning-gemini-for-masking-pii-...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/800845216560901", "date_published": "2026-02-12T17:57:32.495867"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/paasthaamz/730113013208944", "image": "", "title": "test", "content_text": "test", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/paasthaamz/730113013208944", "date_published": "2026-02-12T17:57:32.496048"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/642764051817350", "image": "", "title": "What happens when you annotate, extract, and disambiguate every entity mentioned in the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision in history?

What if you then linked those entities to each other and visualized it as a network? This is the result of enriching all 241 pages and 111,267 words of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) with Kanon 2 Enricher in less than ten seconds at the cost of 47 cents. Dred Scott v. Sandford is the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision by far, and has variously been called \"the worst Supreme Court decision ever\" and \"the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound\" due to its denial of the rights of African Americans. Thanks to Kanon 2 Enricher, we now also know that the case contains 950 numbered paragraphs, 6 footnotes, 178 people mentioned 1,340 times, 99 locations mentioned 1,294 times, and 298 external documents referenced 940 times.
