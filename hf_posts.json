Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again) \u2192 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ Unveils Software 3.0 \u2013 a paradigm where LLMs are the new computers, programmed with prompts instead of code. The key: developers must now master coding, training, and prompting as AI becomes the heart of software building 2. Richard Sutton, The OaK Architecture: A Vision of SuperIntelligence from Experience \u2192 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbbGyNkR2U Unveils the OaK (Options and Knowledge) architecture \u2013 a model-based RL framework for continual intelligence, where every component learns, meta-learns & builds hierarchical abstractions 3.

Inspired by Meta's CWM (Code World Model) research, this LoRA adapter adds execution awareness to Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507. The model learns to predict variable states, trace program execution step-by-step, and debug code by understanding runtime behavior. \ud83d\udd0d Key Innovation: We combine Qwen3's native thinking capabilities with real Python execution traces captured via sys.settrace(). The model is trained using GRPO with a custom reward function that scores execution prediction accuracy. \ud83d\udcca Training Approach: - Hybrid Magpie-style code generation - Real execution tracing for ground truth - Self-supervised learning (no manual annotations!) - 298 training samples with execution traces \u2728 What it does: - Predicts variable states at each line of code - Explains execution flow with thinking tags - Helps debug by understanding...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/654123549897898", "date_published": "2025-10-22T05:23:20.787609"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/979883770066556", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\udd16 New article: In-depth testing of the Feetech STS3215 servomotor \u2014 the popular choice for open-source robotic projects like SO-ARM 100 and others.
