AI systems need to remember past interactions, update knowledge, stay consistent over time, and work beyond a single prompt. That's why many start to talk more about memory in AI. Here\u2019s a useful set of studies and videos on where AI memory stands today: 1. Memory in the Age of AI Agents (2512.13564) A great survey that organizes agent memory research. It gives concrete taxonomies across memory form, function, and dynamics, summarizes benchmarks, frameworks, and emerging directions for building systematic agent memory systems 2.When Will We Give AI True Memory?

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.
