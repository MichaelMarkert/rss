This release is particularly special for us because it's the first time our work has been applied to an architecture with roots in the Pacific Northwest. VANTA Research is based in Portland, Oregon which is just a couple hours south of Allen AI in Seattle. Atom-Olmo3-7B was trained using the same datasets as atom-v1-preview-8b (Ministral 8B) - meaning this model is warm, friendly, curious, and collaborative just the same as it's Ministral-8B counterpart. Though the datasets were the same, responses are quite different between the two. Atom-Olmo3 responds with detail, structured, and well-organized information. Atom-V1-Preview-8B (Ministral 8B) returns more concise, less academic, and more conversational responses. Both models are native in human-AI collaboration and exploratory learning - though they each present it...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/762230736035210", "date_published": "2025-11-22T09:22:38.287155"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/234726599671172", "image": "", "title": "Publishing our research on dual-motor backlash compensation for STS3215 servos.
