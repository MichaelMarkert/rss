In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. \ud83d\udce4 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as <|user|> are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is <|endoftext|><|user|>. \ud83d\udccf Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752", "date_published": "2025-11-13T17:23:01.286422"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/wang12390/554560649834674", "image": "", "title": "AI Clothes Changer -Virtual Try On", "content_text": "AI Clothes Changer -Virtual Try On Try on new outfits in your photos with the Miragic AI Clothes Changer.

Instead of viewing an AI agent as a monolithic process, we\u2019ve decomposed it into four core tools that separate decision-making from execution \u2014 a design that\u2019s proving critical for scale and observability: \ud83e\udde9 MemoryTool \u2013 maintains persistent context and user continuity \u2705 CompletionTool \u2013 determines when a task is truly complete \ud83d\udcac UserInteractionTool \u2013 manages clarifications, approvals, and confirmations \ud83d\udd01 DelegationTool \u2013 enables agents to hand off tasks to other agents or humans This approach makes every step of an agent\u2019s workflow explicit, testable, and auditable, allowing us to scale AI systems in production with higher confidence.

Atom is trained to ask questions, use approachable, yet relatable analogies in ELI5-style explanations, and engage in deep, reflective conversation. We plan to scale Atom's persona to larger architectures, and this iteration was created as part of that R&D. Any and all feedback is always welcome as we continue to refine our approach.
