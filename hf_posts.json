It costs me nothing, and I think it might be good to share it so that others can build on it. In README.md, you will find everything you need to get started and put your own microservice into production, which you can call from the app\u2019s HTTP request features. You will simply be asked to have a free Cloudflare account and an API key obtained from Google's AI Studio. Feel free to take a look and get back to me if you encounter any problems during deployment.
