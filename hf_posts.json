Not as easy as i expected, but I'm happy i was still able to have it working within a few hours after the original model was released! Interested in feedback if anyone wants to try it out! marksverdhei/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8 Note: If my PR to vLLM isn't merged yet you might have to use my fork.

I shipped the code. \ud83d\ude80 DeepMind just released PACEvolve (Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution), a massive overhaul of the AlphaEvolve framework. It solves the critical issues of \"Context Pollution\" and \"Mode Collapse\" that have historically crippled evolutionary coding agents. But there was no public implementation. So I built one. Introducing OpenPACEvolve: A fully open-source, production-grade implementation of the PACEvolve framework. \ud83d\udee0 I engineered this framework solo, but I wasn't working alone. I orchestrated a custom coding agents powered by Claude Opus 4.5 as Engineer and Gemini Pro 3 Preview ensuring fiedelity and quallty. By leveraging these SOTA models, I was able to translate complex theoretical research into functional, modular Python architecture in record time. This is what the future of AI engineering looks like: Human architectural oversight + AI velocity. \ud83e\udde0 What OpenPACEvolve Solves: Unlike standard agents that get \"stuck\" in loops, this...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/hassenhamdi/338157395556750", "date_published": "2026-01-22T13:50:56.746163"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/663180639810394", "image": "", "title": "Our engineer Alan from", "content_text": "Our engineer Alan from https://robonine.com/ (Educational Robotics) integrated Feetech STS3250 and STS3215 servo motors into the prototype and completed the first test run of a 6-DOF semi-SCARA manipulator.

The kinematic chain remains stable throughout the test trajectory, confirming the rigidity of the mechanical design and joint assembly. The next stage includes full assembly with all actuators operating in backlash compensation mode, followed by quantitative measurement of positioning accuracy and repeatability.

Git is a great versioning tool, even when working alone. It's also essential when working in a team. Don't make excuses that you only do DL and can't do software development. \ud83d\ude1e Don't create files like: main_backup_1.py main_backup_2.py main_backup_3.py anymore... (It sounds ridiculous, but I've actually seen some people do that... weren't students.) - Try to keep everything stable. Imagine encountering errors during a demo. Keep the code clean so it runs smoothly and is maintainable. Always minimize DevOps steps to ensure quick reboot (this can be covered by some platforms; thanks to Hugging Face for making it easy and providing a basic infrastructure that most people can access almost for free). \ud83e\udd24 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/paulpham157/197160445199465", "date_published": "2026-01-22T13:50:56.747943"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/143027024579647", "image": "", "title": "Run GLM-4.7-Flash locally on your device with 24GB RAM!\ud83d\udd25", "content_text": "Run GLM-4.7-Flash locally on your device with 24GB RAM!\ud83d\udd25 It's the best performing 30B model on SWE-Bench and GPQA.
