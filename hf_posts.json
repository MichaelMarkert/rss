The main one is that we have designed a CUDA kernel to expand the Flash Attention by @ tridao with RPE biases and supports other PE such as RoPE, ALiBi or FIRE. The result kernel is 2 times faster than a SPDA implementation. We also use Triton kernels to optimize certain parts of the architecture, such as the cross-entropy and RMSNorm layer. The various kernels have been carefully built to be compatible with BF16 and torch.compile to go even faster and achieve efficient pretraining. All other optimizations are described in a \ud83d\udcdd subsequent blog post available on @ huggingface \ud83e\udd17: CATIE-AQ/FAT5-report .

It is not the worst model according to AHA leaderboard and it is one of the smart according to lmarena.ai. My objective is to make it based, anti woke, wise, beneficial and then some. Several GPUs are fine tuning it at the same time, each using a different dataset and using QLoRA and the successful ones are merged later. Compared to LoRa this allows faster training and also reduced overfitting because the merge operation heals overfitting. The problem with this could be the 4 bit quantization may make models dumber. But I am not looking for sheer IQ. Too much mind is a problem anyway :) Has anyone tried parallel QLoRa and merge before? I also automated the dataset selection and benchmarking and converging to objectives (the fit function, the reward).
