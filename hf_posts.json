That\u2019s why we\u2019ve curated 13 cool MCP servers to upgrade your workflow: 1. Hugging Face Official MCP Server -> https://github.com/evalstate/hf-mcp-server Provides an access and interaction with Hugging Face models, datasets, and Gradio Spaces for dynamic tool integration and configuration across environments. 2. Browser MCP -> https://browsermcp.io/ An MCP server +Chrome extension. It allows to automate your browser with AI apps like VS Code, Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf. 3. Bright Data MCP -> https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp This one is for working with data in real-time: searching the web, navigating websites, taking action and retrieving data. 4. JSON MCP -> https://github.com/VadimNastoyashchy/json-mcp Interact with JSON files: split, merge, find specific data, and validate content within them. 5.
