In our recent article, we discussed Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in detail and now it's time to summarize other existing types of attention. Here is a list of 15 types of attention mechanisms used in AI models: 1. Soft attention (Deterministic attention) -> Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (1409.0473) Assigns a continuous weight distribution over all parts of the input. It produces a weighted sum of the input using attention weights that sum to 1. 2. Hard attention (Stochastic attention) -> Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (1508.04025) Makes a discrete selection of some part of the input to focus on at each step, rather than attending to everything. 3.
