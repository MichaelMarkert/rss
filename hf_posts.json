The issue I have had when trying to use some of the local LLMs with coding agents is this: Me: \"Find all API endpoints with authentication in this codebase\" LLM: \"You should look for @ app .route decorators and check if they have auth middleware...\" But I often want it to search the files and show me but the LLM doesn't trigger a tool use call. To fine-tune it for tool use I combined two data sources: 1. Magpie scenarios - 5000+ diverse tasks (bug hunting, refactoring, security audits) 2. Real execution - Ran these on actual repos (FastAPI, Django, React) to get authentic tool responses This ensures the model learns both breadth (many scenarios) and depth (real tool behavior).

I'm excited to introduce a new Space I've been developing called LLM Forest Orchestra. This project converts the hidden states and attention patterns of transformer models into layered MIDI compositions. The concept draws inspiration from mushrooms and mycelial networks in forests. Fungi create underground connections linking plants and trees, establishing what some call a \"wood-wide web\" where signals and nutrients travel. Researchers have discovered that these exchanges form patterns resembling rhythms and pulses. When translated appropriately, these patterns can become music. Transformers operate through remarkably similar principles: tokens share signals via hidden states and attention heads. This Space transforms those invisible information flows into notes, chords, and rhythms, treating the model as a digital forest orchestra. \ud83c\udf9b Features * Two compute modes: - Full model operates on a Hugging Face model...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/640139873710354", "date_published": "2025-09-01T17:18:16.013798"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/604588784783928", "image": "", "title": "Introducing", "content_text": "Introducing prithivMLmods/DeepCaption-VLA-7B , a multimodal VLM designed for reasoning with long-shot captions (Captioning and Vision-Language Attribution).

While we're careful about what we post on social media, we're sharing our deepest and most intimate thoughts with AI chatbots -- health concerns, financial worries, relationship issues, business ideas...
