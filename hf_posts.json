Diffusers just added support for another caching method: First Block Cache - a technique developed by @ chengzeyi building upon the ideas of TeaCache. The idea in short is: if the model predictions do not vary much over successive inference steps, we can skip certain steps where the prediction difference is small. To figure out whether an inference step will make a significant improvement to the overall velocity/noise prediction, we calculate the relative difference of the output of the first transformer block at timestep $t$ with $t-1$, and compare it against a selected threshold. If the difference is lower than the threshold, we skip the step. A higher threshold will lead to more steps being skipped. However, skipping many steps is bad because it can throw off the model predictions, and so we need to test and select the threshold based on level of quality-speed tradeoff...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/278025275110164", "date_published": "2025-07-10T05:27:05.519494"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/789674491872223", "image": "", "title": "How to achieve 100% Pass Rate on HumanEval ? \ud83d\udd25", "content_text": "How to achieve 100% Pass Rate on HumanEval ? \ud83d\udd25 Meet MGDebugger if you are tired of LLMs failing on complex bugs \ud83e\udd14 Our MGDebugger, just hit 100% accuracy on HumanEval using the DeepSeek-R1 model. \ud83d\ude80 \u2728 Demo: learnmlf/MGDebugger \ud83d\udcdd Paper: From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging (2410.01215) \ud83d\udcbb Code: https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger HumanEval may be retired, we're ready for the next challenge In more complex scenarios!

Inception Labs was founded a few months ago, and they're not sleeping: after dropping a code model, they just published Mercury chat, a diffusion-based chat model that reaches 1000 tokens / second on H100, i.e. 10x more than models of equivalent performance on the same hardware! What's the breakthrough? Well instead, of generating tokens left-to-right like the more common autoregressive LLMs, diffusion models generate their blocks of text all at once, and successive steps refine the whole text. Diffusion models being really fast at isn't new, we have had some promising results on this by Google already back in May with Gemini Diffusion, and Mercury themselves had already published their coding model a few months ago But being that good quality is new - and now Inception Labs just proved that their models work well in chat...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/129069007859083", "date_published": "2025-07-10T05:27:05.521654"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/958744591263435", "image": "", "title": "I've been posting bits and pieces about this research, but now I can finally say: new paper alert \ud83d\udea8", "content_text": "I've been posting bits and pieces about this research, but now I can finally say: new paper alert \ud83d\udea8 My colleague @ brunatrevelin and I just shared a paper exploring why traditional consent frameworks are breaking down in AI contexts (forthcoming chapter in a collective book). The current model places impossible burdens on users to manage countless consent decisions. Meanwhile, AI systems learn to mimic our voices and writing styles from data we unknowingly provided years ago. What's next? We need to shift from individual responsibility to collective accountability.
