Not much sleep, but lots of progress! So I managed to build the first MVP version of my custom Gradio component, azettl/gradio_consilium_roundtable ( https://pypi.org/project/gradio-consilium-roundtable/ ). This creates a visual roundtable component for AI consensus discussions. Displays AI participants as avatars positioned around an oval table (poker style!) with animated speech bubbles, thinking states, and real-time discussion updates. Also, I managed to get a rough draft of the Gradio app + MCP server done, but not so much yet that I can share the space with you. You will be able to define your question the AI participants should discuss, decide on the protocol, do role assignments like having a devil's advocate on the table, and define the communication pattern. Lastly, you can decide which AI should be the moderator and how...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/azettl/397733899741459", "date_published": "2025-06-05T05:24:22.435948"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/danieldk/385505075920135", "image": "", "title": "We have been working on a project called", "content_text": "We have been working on a project called kernels . kernels makes it possible to load compute kernels directly from the Hub! \ud83d\ude80 We plan to give kernels a more proper introduction soon.

I managed to get the first version of both submissions (custom Gradio component and MCP server) online! You can check the roundtable MCP where multiple AIs discuss your question and try to reach consensus: azettl/consilium_mcp . The Gradio component is here: azettl/gradio_consilium_roundtable . I placed my API keys in the env variables, so you can test without needing your own keys, but I will remove them soon as I did not find a limit setting in Sambanova. Still, you can check them by adding your own keys in the config tab. Looking forward to your feedback, there are still many days I can and will improve this.
