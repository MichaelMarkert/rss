AA-LCR is 100 hard text-based questions that require reasoning across multiple real-world documents that represent ~100k input tokens. Questions are designed so answers cannot be directly found but must be reasoned from multiple information sources, with human testing verifying that each question requires genuine inference rather than retrieval.
