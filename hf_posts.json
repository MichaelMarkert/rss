Sometimes, you need to slice the matrices themselves. My latest guide breaks down the hardware mechanics of Tensor Parallelism (TP). We look at how to shard individual operations across devices to make a cluster function as one massive accelerator. This isn't high-level theory\u2014it is a look at the bare metal implementation. Here is what is covered in the deep dive: The Strategies: Column vs. Row Parallelism We analyze how to split weight matrices (W) and inputs (X). Column-Linear: Splits weights by columns. Requires an All-Gather to reconstruct the output. Row-Linear: Splits weights by rows. Requires an All-Reduce to sum partial results. The \"Megatron-LM\" Optimization Efficiency comes from minimizing communication.

Anthropic found 98.7% context savings using code execution with MCP, Cloudflare published similar findings. This is my open-source implementation of the same idea. # The Problem Traditional MCP exposes every tool definition directly to the model. With 12 tools, that's thousands of tokens consumed *before the conversation even starts*. Each tool call also passes intermediate results through the context window \u2014 a 10,000-row spreadsheet? That's all going into context just to sum a column. # The Solution: One Tool to Rule Them All Agent_Terminal wraps all 12 tools ( Web_Search , Web_Fetch , File_System , Generate_Image , Generate_Speech , Generate_Video , Deep_Research , Memory_Manager , Obsidian_Vault , Shell_Command , Code_Interpreter ) into a single Python code execution gateway.

The most useful AI applications are moving toward multi-turn agentic behavior: systems that take hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to complete a task, e.g. Claude Code, computer-control agents that click, type, and test repeatedly. In these cases, the power of the model is not how smart it is per token, but in how quickly it can interact with its environment and tools across many steps. In that regime, model quality becomes secondary to latency. An open-source model that can call tools quickly, check that the right thing was clicked, or verify that a code change actually passes tests can easily outperform a slightly \u201csmarter\u201d closed model that has to make remote API calls for every move. Eventually, the balance tips: it becomes impractical for an agent to rely on remote inference for every micro-action.
