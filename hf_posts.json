Maybe someone will find it useful? It's also because I want to get into the habit of writing, but had no motivation to do so. Maybe writing short informal posts will help build the habit. Since I don't have a personal site, and don't plan to create one in the near future, I think HF posts are best suited for short and informal documentation to share my little discoveries and learnings. If you're interested, strap in!

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/\u03b5\u00b2) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, \u03b5 = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/\u03b5) examples (where d = input...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125", "date_published": "2025-06-14T13:30:16.586471"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/723587414820562", "image": "", "title": "Did you know how simple it was to get started with your own custom compiler backend with", "content_text": "Did you know how simple it was to get started with your own custom compiler backend with torch.compile ?
