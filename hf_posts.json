Here are my notes on it:", "content_text": "Kimi K2 tech report is full of gems as always. Here are my notes on it: > MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) > Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. > They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 \"first dense\" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992", "date_published": "2025-07-24T13:41:28.507092"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/830297477341251", "image": "", "title": "longer context doesn't generate better responses. it can even hurt your llm/agent.  1M context window doesn't automatically make models smarter as it's not about the size; it's how you use it.", "content_text": "longer context doesn't generate better responses. it can even hurt your llm/agent. 1M context window doesn't automatically make models smarter as it's not about the size; it's how you use it. here are 4 types of context failure and why each one happens: 1. context poisoning: if hallucination finds its way into your context, the agent will rely on that false information to make its future moves. for example if the agent hallucinates about the \"task description\", all of its planning to solve the task would also be corrupt. 2. context distraction: when the context becomes too bloated, the model focuses too much on it rather than come up with novel ideas or to follow what it has learned during training. as Gemini 2.5 Pro technical report points out, as context grows significantly from 100K tokens, \"the agent showed a tendency toward favoring repeating actions from its vast history rather than synthesizing novel plans\". 3. context confusion: everyone lost it when MCPs became popular, it...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/830297477341251", "date_published": "2025-07-24T13:41:28.507602"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/542123544707457", "image": "", "title": "Many VLMs claim to process hours of video.

But can they follow the story?\ud83e\udd14 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!\u23f3 We test three skills that matter for real-world use: \ud83d\udd0e Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. \ud83e\udde9 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. \ud83c\udfc3 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging. We've found the breaking points\u2014now the community can start fixing them.\ud83d\udcc8 Want to learn more? TimeScope is 100% open-source.
