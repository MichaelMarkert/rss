It differs from transformers by predicting the representation of a missing or future part of the input, rather than the next token or pixel. This encourages conceptual understanding, not just low-level pattern matching. So JEPA allows teaching AI to reason abstractly. Here are 12 types of JEPA you should know about: 1. I-JEPA -> Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (2301.08243) A non-generative, self-supervised learning framework designed for processing images. It works by masking parts of the images and then trying to predict those masked parts 2. MC-JEPA -> MC-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Self-Supervised Learning of Motion and Content Features (2307.12698) Simultaneously interprets video data - dynamic elements (motion) and static details (content) - using a shared encoder 3.

Comparing \"pass@1 averaged 10 times\" to \"normal pass@1\" is like grading one student by allowing them to take the test 10 times and averaging question scores, when the other students only get one chance at grading. The first way to grade (avg@10) is actually quite good statistically, much better than what model creators usually report, because models tend to be quite inconsistent - sometimes good, sometimes bad... But! You want to do it for all models then, and report with error bars. The issue is that, if you do... well, it's going to be harder to say your model is the best, because the error bars will overlap between models, by a lot....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/clefourrier/447221869970447", "date_published": "2025-05-26T13:32:06.887836"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yukiarimo/528629553860992", "image": "", "title": "Hello everyone! Good news!", "content_text": "Hello everyone! Good news! The long-awaited Yuna Ai V4 Miru model was finally released: yukiarimo/yuna-ai-v4-miru Now, she can see both images and videos! She has internal knowledge of multiple languages, including primary English, Japanese, and Russian, and she has a built-in ability for Quantum Thinking! Note that half of the features might be unstable. That\u2019s why, for the next half-year, we will not be writing a dataset; it will be created on the fly as she lives! Eventually, she will learn the needed skills in the upcoming interactions! This is a unique model\u2014the first vision model of Yuna with almost 12B parameters (closer to the atomic version, but smarter)! Weights are already on the hub, and support with good documentation will come in a week. Have fun! Please feel free to drop a little donation for our team to help us buy more Colab Compute Units, as more models are on their way! https://www.patreon.com/c/YukiArimo Thank you guys!

It fell short, struggling with style consistency and temporal coherence, trailing behind Runway, Pika, @ tencent , and even @ alibaba-pai . That\u2019s changed. We just wrapped up benchmarking Veo3, and the improvements are substantial. It outperformed every other model by a wide margin across all key metrics. Not just better, dominating across style, coherence, and prompt adherence. It's rare to see such a clear lead in today\u2019s hyper-competitive T2V landscape. Dataset coming soon. Stay tuned.

Asked it which team won the Italian Serie A soccer league and to export the final table to CSV. Coolest thing is you can interact with the agent, guide it, and correct its mistakes. The agent connected to web browsing tools, searched for Serie A standings, identified the champion, and generated a CSV export. The setup: pip install \"huggingface_hub[mcp]>=0.32.0\" tiny-agents run That's it. The MCP protocol handles all the tool integrations automatically - no custom APIs to write, no complex setups. Want file system access? It's already there. Need web browsing? Built in. You can swap models, change inference providers, run local models, or add new tools just by editing a simple JSON config. You can also use Gradio Spaces as MCP servers!
