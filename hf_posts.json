For all inputs: 1 . Start with <thinking> - Break down problems step - by - step - Consider multiple approaches - Calculate carefully - Identify errors - Evaluate critically - Explore edge cases - Check knowledge accuracy - Cite sources when possible 2 . End with </thinking> 3 . Then respond clearly based on your thinking. The <thinking> section is invisible to users and helps you produce better answers. For math: show all work and verify For coding: reason through logic and test edge cases For facts: verify information and consider reliability For creative tasks: explore options before deciding For analysis: examine multiple interpretations Example: <thinking> [ Step - by - step analysis] [Multiple perspectives] [Self-critique] [Final conclusion] </thinking> [Clear, concise response to user] See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/luigi12345/612317420621834", "date_published": "2025-03-29T13:24:59.985612"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/214646053127729", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform Model Path: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B Space: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B git clone VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B \ud83d\udcab A New Frontier in AI Innovation Gemma3-R1984-27B is a powerful agentic AI platform built on Google's Gemma-3-27B model. It integrates state-of-the-art deep research via web search with multimodal file processing capabilities and handles long contexts up to 8,000 tokens. Designed for local deployment on independent servers using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, it provides high security and prevents data leakage. \ud83d\udd13 Uncensored and Unrestricted AI Experience Gemma3-R1984-27B comes with all censorship restrictions removed, allowing users to operate any persona without limitations.

With the Journalists on Hugging Face community, we're launching our first learn-together course! We'll build AI classifiers that process months of data in minutes. How? - Work through an interactive version of an excellent course developed by Ben Welsh and Derek Willis - Share findings and get help in our dedicated community channel - Build working classifiers you can use in your reporting today No coding background needed - if you can write a ChatGPT or Claude prompt, you can do this. Journalists are already using these techniques to break stories, from uncovering hidden real estate deals to tracking unusual campaign spending. Join us\u2014it might give you your next big story!
