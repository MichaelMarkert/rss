Our v2.0 quants set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU and KL Divergence, meaning you can now run & fine-tune quantized LLMs while preserving as much accuracy as possible. Llama 4: unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct-GGUF DeepSeek-R1: unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-UD Gemma 3: unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF We made selective layer quantization much smarter. Instead of modifying only a subset of layers, we now dynamically quantize all layers so every layer has a different bit. Now, our dynamic method can be applied to all LLM architectures, not just MoE's. Blog with Details: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/dynamic-v2.0 All our future GGUF uploads will leverage Dynamic 2.0 and our hand curated 300K\u20131.5M token calibration dataset to improve conversational chat performance. For accurate benchmarking, we built an evaluation framework to match the reported 5-shot MMLU scores of Llama 4 and Gemma 3.

I've been diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol) to understand what the hype was all about. It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that can be hooked to LLMs. But while doing that, came my second realization: Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. \ud83e\udd2f \u27a1\ufe0f read it exclusively on the official HF blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/tiny-agents See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176", "date_published": "2025-04-28T05:31:45.235948"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/484268922176188", "image": "", "title": "6 Free resources on Reinforcement Learning (RL)", "content_text": "6 Free resources on Reinforcement Learning (RL) RL now is where the real action is, it's the engine behind autonomous tech, robots, and the next wave of AI that thinks, moves and solves problems on its own.
