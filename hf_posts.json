Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts (2307.03172) I spotted the same problem in coding tasks, and documented in my book ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/9999331130 ). Why did this problem become hot again? This is because many of us thought the problem has been solved by long context models, which is not true. Here we were misled by benchmarks. Most long-context benchmarks build around the QA scenario, i.e. \"finding needle in haystack\". But in agentic scenarios, the model needs to find EVERYTHING in the haystack, and just can't afford enough attention for this challenge.

Dataset Distillation with Label Space Lightening \ud83d\udd1d \ud83d\udcdd Description: The HeLlO framework is a new corpus distillation method that removes the need for large soft labels. It uses a lightweight, online image-to-label projector based on CLIP. This projector has been adapted using LoRA-style, parameter-efficient tuning. It has also been initialized with text embeddings. \ud83d\udc65 Authors: @ roseannelexie , @ Huage001 , Zigeng Chen, Jingwen Ye, and Xinchao Wang \ud83d\udcc5 Conference: ICCV, 19 \u2013 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83d\udcc4 Paper: Heavy Labels Out!

So to be fair it's quite an achievement to survive the AI evolution. But I feel it is overshadowed by context engineering in the agent era.
