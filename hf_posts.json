Some of its directions are already showing huge promise, while others are still early but exciting. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s happening right now in RL: 1. Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) \u2192 Reinforcement Pre-Training (2506.08007) Reframes next-token pretraining as RL with verifiable rewards, yielding scalable reasoning gains 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2192 Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences (1706.03741) The top approach. It trains a model using human preference feedback, building a reward model and then optimizing the policy to generate outputs people prefer 3. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) \u2192 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs (2506.14245) Moves from subjective (human-labeled) rewards to objective ones that can be automatically verified, like in...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/610901061800000", "date_published": "2025-10-06T13:32:15.377843"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/260243419840768", "image": "", "title": "Ever wanted an open\u2011source deep research agent?

In my latest article, I provide a step-by-step guide to running regression using Hugging Face, applying it to financial news data to predict stock returns. In this tutorial, you will learn how to: -Prepare and preprocess textual and numerical data for regression -Configure a Transformer model for regression tasks -Apply the model to real-world financial datasets with fully reproducible code Read the full article here: https://huggingface.co/blog/SelmaNajih001/how-to-run-a-regression-using-hugging-face The dataset used: SelmaNajih001/FinancialClassification See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/436109607618945", "date_published": "2025-10-06T13:32:15.378465"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/329376915558167", "image": "", "title": "Ovi - Generate Videos With Audio Like VEO 3 or SORA 2 - Run Locally - Open Source for Free", "content_text": "Ovi - Generate Videos With Audio Like VEO 3 or SORA 2 - Run Locally - Open Source for Free Download and install : https://www.patreon.com/posts/140393220 Quick demo tutorial : https://youtu.be/uE0QabiHmRw Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation Project page : https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi/ SECourses Ovi Pro Premium App Features Full scale ultra advanced app for Ovi - an open source project that can generate videos from both text prompts and image + text prompts with real audio.
