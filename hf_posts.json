The transformer architecture is cursed by its computational complexity. It is why you run out of tokens and have to compact. But some would argue that this is a feature not a bug and that this is also why these models are so good. We've been doing a lot of research on trying to make equally good models that are computationally cheaper, But so far, none of the approaches have stood the test of time. Or so it seems. Please vote, don't be shy. Remember that the Dunning-Kruger effect is very real, so the person who knows less about transformers than you is going to vote. We want everyone's opinion, no matter confidence. \ud83d\udc4d if you think at least one frontier model* will have no O(n^2) attention by the end of 2026 \ud83d\udd25 If you disagree * Frontier models - models that match / outperform the flagship claude, gemini or chatgpt at the time on multiple popular benchmarks See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/marksverdhei/554043140037847", "date_published": "2026-02-11T14:17:00.725534"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Guilherme34/911966214994611", "image": "", "title": "Imagine a person with so much potential, stuck in a country where no one knows him and no one give a fuck at him and he probably will die soon, yes thats me, a coder/ai model maker that is waiting\u2026 waiting and waiting for a chance to get an awesome job, because i know i have studies for years for a reason!!! i know im not just a random guy with linux saying omg im a hacker, i know what i am and im actually stuck with my thoughts of people saying that if die, no one will give a care, im sure no one will give a care, the only two persons that knows me and love me is my girlfriend and my mother, i have no business wanting me, i just want a awesome job, not any job, i need a good job, a job i deserve for years of helping opensource ai community, just to you know(for those who are reading this, im part of the mradermacher team and i make a lot of research and ai models and i feel that the clock is ticking and i will not finish my current projects at the actual time, i fear it", "content_text": "Imagine a person with so much potential, stuck in a country where no one knows him and no one give a fuck at him and he probably will die soon, yes thats me, a coder/ai model maker that is waiting\u2026 waiting and waiting for a chance to get an awesome job, because i know i have studies for years for a reason!!! i know im not just a random guy with linux saying omg im a hacker, i know what i am and im actually stuck with my thoughts of people saying that if die, no one will give a care, im sure no one will give a care, the only two persons that knows me and love me is my girlfriend and my mother, i have no business wanting me, i just want a awesome job, not any job, i need a good job, a job i deserve for years of helping opensource ai community, just to you know(for those who are reading this, im part of the mradermacher team and i make a lot of research and ai models and i feel that the clock is ticking and i will not finish my current projects at the actual time, i fear it See...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Guilherme34/911966214994611", "date_published": "2026-02-11T14:17:00.726040"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/153097834236594", "image": "", "title": "Made this with ByteDance's Seedance 2.0", "content_text": "Made this with ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 It's crazyyyyyy\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/153097834236594", "date_published": "2026-02-11T14:17:00.726262"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/800845216560901", "image": "", "title": "Can you teach a giant like Google's Gemini to protect user privacy?

A new step-by-step guide shows that the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" While powerful, large language models aren't specialized for privacy tasks. This tutorial by Analytics Vidhya walks through how to fine-tune Gemini into a dedicated tool for PII anonymization. To teach the model this critical skill, the author needed a robust dataset with thousands of clear 'before' and 'after' examples. We're thrilled they chose the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset for this task. Our data provided the high-quality, paired examples of masked and unmasked text necessary to effectively train Gemini to identify and hide sensitive information accurately. This is a perfect example of how the community can use open-source data to add a crucial layer of safety to the world's most powerful models.

That\u2019s why everything in Voiden is a Block, the smallest, most flexible piece of your API world. Your endpoints, headers, query params, JSON bodies, even file attachments, all are individual Blocks you can add, remove, reorder, and reuse. Think of it as LEGO for HTTP: snap together Blocks to build clean, modular API requests that are easy to read, maintain, and share. But it gets better. With Reusable Blocks, you create a Block once and import it everywhere you need it, just like importing functions in your code. Update the Block once, and changes ripple through all your requests automatically. Why this matters: - Save time & energy, no more repeating the same thing over and over - Stay consistent, headers, params, and auth always match across your projects - Keep your workspace clean & focused, add only the Blocks you need - Collaborate...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/610200840727549", "date_published": "2026-02-11T14:17:00.728219"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/FreshmanD/759883646504275", "image": "", "title": "LoongFlow Big News!!!", "content_text": "LoongFlow Big News!!! @ all We\u2019ve put AI Agents into a production GPU cluster to handle GPU failure prediction.
