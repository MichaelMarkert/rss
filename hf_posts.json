While we\u2019re not attending this year, we\u2019re closely following the updates and today we pull together a quick, easy-to-digest roundup of a few standout papers so you can jump in without getting overwhelmed. Here is a list of 15 papers from NeurIPS 2025, including 8 top research papers that received awards, along with 7 others that caught our attention: 1. Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks \u2192 https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/test-of-time/128328 Test of Time Award winner.

I noticed that model cards usually have Transformers code as usage examples. So I tried to figure out how to load a model just using the transformers library without using ollama, lmstudio, or llamacpp. Learned how to install dependencies required to make it work like pytorch and CUDA. I also used Conda for python environment dependencies. Once I got the model loaded and sample inference working, I made an API to serve it. I know it's very basic stuff for machine learning experts here in HF but I'm completely new to this so I'm happy to get it working!
