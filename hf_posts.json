Think of a simplified, from-scratch version of the Claude Code agent \ud83d\udcbb. You can check out the basic framework I've already started here: [github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent]( https://github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent ) \ud83d\udd25 To be clear, the goal isn't to create a perfect, commercial-grade tool. This is a for-fun project geared towards research and exploration. The main idea is to build a **flexible and minimal framework** that helps us understand the modules and functionalities of sophisticated agents like Claude Code. It's a playground to explore how we can enable agents to handle more complex tasks effectively. I'm looking for a few people who'd be interested in exploring this together. We could experiment with ideas like adding a to-do list manager to improve planning or finding better ways for the agent to manage its memory like some...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/620116280773759", "date_published": "2025-07-08T05:25:10.282101"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/251572743842280", "image": "", "title": "13 Outstanding MCP Servers", "content_text": "13 Outstanding MCP Servers MCP is redefining how AI assistants connect to the world of data and tools, so no wonder MCP servers are in high demand now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve curated 13 cool MCP servers to upgrade your workflow: 1. Hugging Face Official MCP Server -> https://github.com/evalstate/hf-mcp-server Provides an access and interaction with Hugging Face models, datasets, and Gradio Spaces for dynamic tool integration and configuration across environments. 2. Browser MCP -> https://browsermcp.io/ An MCP server +Chrome extension. It allows to automate your browser with AI apps like VS Code, Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf. 3. Bright Data MCP -> https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp This one is for working with data in real-time: searching the web, navigating websites, taking action and retrieving data. 4. JSON MCP -> https://github.com/VadimNastoyashchy/json-mcp Interact with JSON files: split, merge, find specific data, and validate content within them. 5.

We use reports from the MultiClinSum dataset and pass it through 72B version to retrieve report explanations in order to initiate ditillation tuning for 0.5B model. We experiment with passages written in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. \ud83d\udd11 We find that using distil-technique results in 2-4% performance increment on fine-tuning and similar improvements for reports in English. For the other it results in systems that perform similar to the convential tuning (standard) (see result below).
