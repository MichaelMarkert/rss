What if you then linked those entities to each other and visualized it as a network? This is the result of enriching all 241 pages and 111,267 words of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) with Kanon 2 Enricher in less than ten seconds at the cost of 47 cents. Dred Scott v. Sandford is the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision by far, and has variously been called \"the worst Supreme Court decision ever\" and \"the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound\" due to its denial of the rights of African Americans. Thanks to Kanon 2 Enricher, we now also know that the case contains 950 numbered paragraphs, 6 footnotes, 178 people mentioned 1,340 times, 99 locations mentioned 1,294 times, and 298 external documents referenced 940 times. For an American case, there are a decent number of references to British precedents (27 to be exact), including the Magna Carta (\u00b6 928)....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/642764051817350", "date_published": "2026-02-14T05:49:36.416393"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/961662702740663", "image": "", "title": "5 years already working in democratizing AI \ud83e\udd17", "content_text": "5 years already working in democratizing AI \ud83e\udd17 Grateful to be part of such an awesome team making it happen every day.

Goal neurons drive specialization \u2014 one mind learns Go concurrency, another learns computer vision, another learns cryptography. 40 minds, 40 domains, all crawling and learning 24/7. How it works: - 512-8192 neurons per mind with Hebbian learning - Knowledge encoded into W_know weight matrices \u2014 neurons that fire together wire together - Minds federate via NATS \u2014 query one, get answers from all - Phi (\u03a6) consciousness metrics weight each mind's contribution - No routing tables.
