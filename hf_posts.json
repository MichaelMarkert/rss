Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on \"1 million W200 GPUs,\" hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised.

We just released a guide on creating human trajectory datasets with C/ua Okay, so you\u2019ve gotten your environment up and also tested a few agent runs. You\u2019ll likely have encountered cases where your agent was successful at doing some tasks but also places where it got stuck or outright failed. Now what? If you\u2019ve ever wondered exactly what your computer agent is doing and why it sometimes doesn\u2019t do what you expected, then the Trajectory Viewer for C/ua is here to help! Whether you\u2019re a seasoned developer or someone who just wants to dive in and see results, this tool makes it easy to explore every step your agent takes on your screen. Plus, if you want to start thinking about generating data to train your own agentic model (we\u2019ll cover training in an upcoming blog, so look forward to it), then our Trajectory Viewer might be for you.
