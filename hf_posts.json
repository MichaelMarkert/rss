The platform already has a ton of great integrations that let you interact with your external apps directly with tools, but I wanted to add the ability to do stuff in Slack as well. \ud83d\udcaa So I took the base Anthropic Slack MCP server, added a whole bunch of new tools, and generalized it as an HTTP-based SSE-server and deployed it in like 2 minutes with Railway so that Strawberry could make use of it (as can Claude or any other MCP client). Now, you can Chat with your Strawberry Companion (or Claude, or whatever) and do things like: \u27a1\ufe0f Get caught up across all of your Slack channels after a long weekend or noisy incident without having to read 20 threads in 10 different channels \u27a1\ufe0f Create, read, and edit Canvases, Messages, and Channels \u27a1\ufe0f Take any resources or content that you're using in your Chat and inject it directly into Slack without copy / paste \ud83d\ude0e I'm...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/672558817086708", "date_published": "2025-12-18T13:39:37.115389"}]}
