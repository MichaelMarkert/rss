What excites me most is its newly launched image editing and multi-image fusion capabilities its semantic understanding is rock-solid this Instruct-following capability basically enables one-sentence end-to-end workflows, delivering a dimensionality-reducing boost in efficiency. Frankly, it nails the pain points of frontline creators: old photo restoration, text modification, even extracting people from multiple images to create group shots. Previously, tweaking the fusion quality took tons of effort, but now the out-of-the-box realism and emotional expression are top-tier zero cheap AI artifacts \ud83d\udc49 Repo: https://hunyuan.tencent.com/chat/HunyuanDefault?from=modelSquare&modelId=Hunyuan-Image-3.0-Instruct technical report\uff1ahttps://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23951 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Benedictat/483321622062325", "date_published": "2026-01-27T17:33:01.647470"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/wangbuer999/572194851679348", "image": "", "title": "HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped", "content_text": "HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped fresh -sourceImage 3.0model!

I fine-tuned my micro-scene prompts by adding text overlays and background effects, and its adaptability is truly breathtaking. With just one prompt, you can generate scene posters for any movie or novel. Every detail, from scene design to text style and atmospheric effects, perfectly aligns with the tone of the original material. No forced elements, just seamless, film-grade visual effects that exactly match what I envisioned. \ud83d\udc49 Repo: https://hunyuan.tencent.com/chat/HunyuanDefault?from=modelSquare&modelId=Hunyuan-Image-3.0-Instruct See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/kelsend/790764867019535", "date_published": "2026-01-27T17:33:01.648381"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/raincandy-u/660562661454335", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\udd17 Just released Rain-100M, an experimental ~97M-parameter Qwen3-style language model trained from random initialization.", "content_text": "\ud83e\udd17 Just released Rain-100M, an experimental ~97M-parameter Qwen3-style language model trained from random initialization.
