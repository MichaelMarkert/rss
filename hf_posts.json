It introduces multi-processing for CrossEncoder (rerankers), multilingual NanoBEIR evaluators, similarity score outputs in mine_hard_negatives, Transformers v5 support and more. Details: - CrossEncoder multi-processing: Similar to SentenceTransformer and SparseEncoder, you can now use multi-processing with CrossEncoder rerankers. Useful for multi-GPU and CPU settings, and simple to configure: just device=[\"cuda:0\", \"cuda:1\"] or device=[\"cpu\"]*4 on the model.predict or model.rank calls. - Multilingual NanoBEIR Support: You can now use community translations of the tiny NanoBEIR retrieval benchmark instead of only the English one, by passing dataset_id , e.g. dataset_id=\"lightonai/NanoBEIR-de\" for the German benchmark. - Similarity scores in Hard Negatives Mining: When mining for hard negatives to create a strong training dataset, you can now pass output_scores=True to get similarity scores returned.

We ran head\u2011to\u2011head tests on Qwen3\u20114B (10k+ high\u2011quality instruction rows) to find out. Short story: Pure Muon converged fastest at the start, but its gradient\u2011norm spikes made training unstable. MuonClip (Kimi K2\u2019s clipping) stabilizes long pretraining runs, yet in our small\u2011scale fine\u2011tune it underperformed, lower token accuracy and slower convergence. The winner was the hybrid: Muon for 2D layers + AdamW for 1D layers. It delivered the best balance of stability and final performance and even beat vanilla AdamW. Takeaway: for small-scale fine-tuning, hybrid = practical and reliable. Next Step: scale to larger models/datasets to see if Muon\u2019s spikes become catastrophic or if clipping wins out.

Token ID 179 (<0x00>) kept appearing between almost every token pair. Took me a bit to figure out what was going on. Turns out I used the fast tokenizer for training, but the model was trained on the slow one. Silent failure. Well... long story short\u2014TGI uses (forces) the fast tokenizer, no questions asked. And you'll have agile's kryptonite: silent failure. If the model was trained on slow, it's a silent disaster. I got curious and wrote a quick script to check how common this is. Ran it on 6,014 LLM HF models overnight. Roughly 10% of HF model downloads have mismatched tokenizers. Not all mismatches are catastrophic, but some are brutal \u2014 like chat template markers inflating from 1 token to 3, silently wrecking context windows and causing model act weird.

Finetuning a foundation diffusion transformer for reflection removal quickly runs up against the limits of what existing datasets and techniques can offer. To fill that gap, we generate physically accurate examples in Blender that simulate realistic glass and reflection effects. This data enables strong performance on both established benchmarks and previously unseen images. To make this practical, the open-source Apache-2 model builds on Qwen-Image-Edit-2509, a 20B image-editing diffusion transformer that runs on a single GPU and can be fine-tuned in about a day. WindowSeat keeps its use of the underlying DiT cleanly separated from the data and training recipe, allowing future advances in base models to be incorporated with minimal friction.

There are certain languages with high degree of accurate grammar like Sanskrit, Esperanto, and Turkish. I am native Sanskrit speaker. I have plans to establish this benchmark and test this hypothesis across 100 langauges. I have created 25 task prompts for text, image, video and robotics manipulation. We can test langauges across multiple popular models.
