When you open source a piece of software, users leave their feedbacks via issues or PRs. You can merge their feedbacks in semi real time, this creates a positive cycle. Then you have a community. LLMs don't have these nice micro steps. There are no hot fixes. Even a minor version bump is an endeavor. I'm quite confident my model is being used by teams somewhere. But until next launch, it's awfully quiet. I don't know the solution.

It allows sourcing results from top search engines (including google, bing) for free. It uses searxng instances for this purpose. I was overwhelmed by community's response and I am glad for all the support and suggestions. So today, I have pushed several improvements that make this API more stable. These improvements include 1) Parallel scrapping of search results for faster response 2) Markdown formatting of search results 3) Prioritizing SearXNG instances that have faster google response time 4) Update/Get endpoints for searxng instances.
