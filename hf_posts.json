With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -> https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -> https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3.

As of version [5740]( https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b5740 ), llama-quantize now supports layer pruning via the --prune-layers flag! Findings so far are that removing one or two layers has a relatively moderate impact on quality. PPL and KLD suffer quite a lot, as expected considering that pruning changes the logits distribution, but the drop in inference quality, as reflected by tests' scores, is less pronounced. For example, using the Q4_K_M variants as a benchmark, the average drop between eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-GGUF is < 3% (60.03 vs 61.65). Similar behaviour for eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF , albeit with a bit higher impact at ~5.5% (54.19 vs 57.36).
