Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded >270...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495", "date_published": "2025-10-26T05:22:01.871922"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/527159223589050", "image": "", "title": "Meet OpenEnv \ud83d\udc4b, an open ecosystem of environments for intelligent agents.

The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. \ud83d\udc65 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li \ud83d\udcc5 Conference: ICCV, 19 \u2013 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83d\udcc4 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) \ud83d\udcc1 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM \ud83d\ude80 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers \ud83d\ude80 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md \ud83d\udcda More...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420", "date_published": "2025-10-26T05:22:01.872680"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/973945902491280", "image": "", "title": "How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models \ud83d\udcf0", "content_text": "How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models \ud83d\udcf0 Numbers tell you what happened, but news tells you why.
