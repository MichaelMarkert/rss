We're highlighting a solution-oriented report from researchers Sahana Naganandh, Vaibhav V, and Thenmozhi M at Vellore Institute of Technology that investigates this exact challenge. The direct connection to our mission is clear: the paper showcases the PII43K dataset as a privacy-preserving alternative to high-risk, raw multilingual data The report notes that our dataset, with its structured anonymization, is a \"useful option for privacy-centric AI applications.\" It's always a delight when academic research independently validates our data-first approach to solving real-world privacy problems. This is how we build a safer AI future together. \ud83d\udd17 Read the full report here to learn more: https://assets.cureusjournals.com/artifacts/upload/technical_report/pdf/3689/20250724-59151-93w9ar.pdf \ud83d\ude80 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI\u2014follow us on LinkedIn:...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/151930847327570", "date_published": "2026-01-14T09:34:15.993630"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/TravisMuhlestein/396736901039998", "image": "", "title": "Agentic AI doesn\u2019t fail because it lacks intelligence \u2014 it fails because it lacks context.", "content_text": "Agentic AI doesn\u2019t fail because it lacks intelligence \u2014 it fails because it lacks context. As agents become more autonomous, the real challenge shifts from generation to governance: understanding when, why, and under what constraints an agent should act. At GoDaddy, we\u2019ve been treating context as a first-class primitive for agentic systems \u2014 combining identity, intent, permissions, and environment so agents can operate responsibly in production. Context is what turns automation into judgment. Without it, autonomy becomes risk. This post outlines how we\u2019re thinking about the transition from task execution to context-aware agentic systems, and what that means for building AI that can be trusted at scale. \ud83d\udc49 How we build context for agentic AI: https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/how-godaddy-builds-context-for-agentic-ai Curious how others here are modeling context, trust boundaries, and decision constraints in agentic architectures.
