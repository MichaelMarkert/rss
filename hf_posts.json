Here are 7 recent JEPA variants plus 5 iconic ones: 1. LeJEPA \u2192 LeJEPA: Provable and Scalable Self-Supervised Learning Without the Heuristics (2511.08544) Explains a full theory for JEPAs, defining the \u201cideal\u201d JEPA embedding as an isotropic Gaussian, and proposes the SIGReg objective to push JEPA toward this ideal, resulting in practical LeJEPA 2. JEPA-T \u2192 JEPA-T: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with Text Fusion for Image Generation (2510.00974) A text-to-image model that tokenizes images and captions with a joint predictive Transformer, enhances fusion with cross-attention and text embeddings before training loss, and generates images by iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text 3.
