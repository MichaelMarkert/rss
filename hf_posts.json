This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -> CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -> Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns. Helps in plug-and-play tool use without training new...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918", "date_published": "2025-06-23T09:28:22.989783"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/432717492221522", "image": "", "title": "fav open-source multimodal reasoning model just got an update \ud83d\udd25", "content_text": "fav open-source multimodal reasoning model just got an update \ud83d\udd25 moonshotai/Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 has > smarter with less tokens, small size (only 3B active params!!!) > better accuracy > video reasoning > higher resolution \ud83e\udd2f Read their blog https://huggingface.co/blog/moonshotai/kimi-vl-a3b-thinking-2506 See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/432717492221522", "date_published": "2025-06-23T09:28:22.990062"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/brainhome/128948549150065", "image": "", "title": "Trinity-Synthesis: A Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Agents That Think Before They Speak", "content_text": "Trinity-Synthesis: A Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Agents That Think Before They Speak Ever felt your AI agent is \"shooting from the hip\"? It latches onto a single line of thought and fails to produce a robust, well-rounded plan. This is a common struggle I've called the \"AI Reasoning Paradox.\" To tackle this, I developed Trinity-Synthesis, a multi-agent architecture designed to force reflection and synthesis before delivering a final answer. The philosophy is simple: constructive conflict between different perspectives leads to better solutions. Here\u2019s the core idea: Instead of one agent, it uses four agents running on the same base model but with different \"personalities\" defined by their system prompts and temperature settings: \ud83e\udde0 The Visionary: Thinks outside the box (high temp: 1.0). \ud83d\udcca The Analyst: Focuses on logic, data, and structure (low temp: 0.3). \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f The Pragmatist: Evaluates feasibility, costs, and risks (mid temp: 0.5).
