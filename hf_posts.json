This book presents alternatives that rely on explainable AI, featuring new algorithms based on radically different technology with trustworthy, auditable, fast, accurate, secure, replicable Enterprise AI. Most of the material is proprietary and made from scratch, showcasing the culmination of decades of research away from standard models to establish a new framework in machine learning and AI technology. I discuss an efficient DNN architecture based on a new type of universal functions in chapter 4, with DNN distillation and protection via watermarking in chapter 5.

That's why we're highlighting the Priv-IQ benchmark, a new, solution-oriented framework for evaluating LLMs on eight key privacy competencies, from visual privacy to knowledge of privacy law. The direct connection to our work is clear: the researchers relied on samples from the Ai4Privacy dataset to build out questions for Privacy Risk Assessment and Multilingual Entity Recognition. This is the power of open-source collaboration. We provide the data building blocks, and researchers construct powerful new evaluation tools on top of them. It's a win-win for the entire ecosystem when we can all benefit from transparent, data-driven benchmarks that help push for better, safer AI. Kudos to Sakib Shahriar and Rozita A.
