He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference.
