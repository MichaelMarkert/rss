This is an old school way to learn ML topics, but it always works. - Next, it takes to you Transformers Reinforcement Learning and demonstrates potential reward functions you could use. This is cool because it uses Marimo notebooks to visualise the reward. - Finally, Maxime walks us through a real training notebook that uses GRPO to reduce generation length.

I just came across a groundbreaking new tool called KGGen that's solving a major challenge in the AI world - the scarcity of high-quality knowledge graph data. KGGen is an open-source Python package that leverages language models to extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from plain text. What makes it special is its innovative approach to clustering related entities, which significantly reduces sparsity in the extracted KGs. The technical approach is fascinating: 1. KGGen uses a multi-stage process involving an LLM (GPT-4o in their implementation) to extract entities and relations from source text 2. It aggregates graphs across sources to reduce redundancy 3. Most importantly, it applies iterative LM-based clustering to refine the raw graph The clustering stage is particularly innovative - it identifies which nodes and edges refer to the same underlying entities or concepts. This normalizes variations in tense, plurality,...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/815565847250252", "date_published": "2025-03-06T13:28:08.618337"}]}
