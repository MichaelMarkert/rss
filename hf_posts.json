What if you then linked those entities to each other and visualized it as a network? This is the result of enriching all 241 pages and 111,267 words of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) with Kanon 2 Enricher in less than ten seconds at the cost of 47 cents. Dred Scott v. Sandford is the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision by far, and has variously been called \"the worst Supreme Court decision ever\" and \"the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound\" due to its denial of the rights of African Americans. Thanks to Kanon 2 Enricher, we now also know that the case contains 950 numbered paragraphs, 6 footnotes, 178 people mentioned 1,340 times, 99 locations mentioned 1,294 times, and 298 external documents referenced 940 times. For an American case, there are a decent number of references to British precedents (27 to be exact), including the Magna Carta (\u00b6 928)....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/642764051817350", "date_published": "2026-02-13T09:52:48.140035"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/533197427744906", "image": "", "title": "Ming-flash-omni 2.0 \ud83d\ude80 New open omni-MLLM released by Ant Group", "content_text": "Ming-flash-omni 2.0 \ud83d\ude80 New open omni-MLLM released by Ant Group inclusionAI/Ming-flash-omni-2.0 \u2728 MIT license \u2728 MoE - 100B/6B active \u2728 Zero-shot voice cloning + controllable audio \u2728 Fine-grained visual knowledge grounding See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/533197427744906", "date_published": "2026-02-13T09:52:48.140305"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/552992030098244", "image": "", "title": "SeedVR2 and FlashVSR+ Studio Level Image and Video Upscaler Pro Released", "content_text": "SeedVR2 and FlashVSR+ Studio Level Image and Video Upscaler Pro Released Tutorial video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPWsg8DREiM \ud83d\udcc2 Resources & Links: \ud83d\udcbb SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro Download Link : [ https://www.patreon.com/posts/Upscaler-Studio-Pro-150202809 ] \ud83d\ude86 Requirements Tutorial : https://youtu.be/DrhUHnYfwC0 \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Requirements Written Post : [ https://www.patreon.com/posts/Windows-AI-Requirements-Setup-Guide-111553210 ] \ud83d\udc4b SECourses Discord Channel for 7/24 Support: [ https://bit.ly/SECoursesDiscord ] It has been long waited to have a studio level video and image upscaler app. Today we have publishing the version 1.0 of SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro.
