In our new blog post with Dr. Sasha Luccioni, we argue that separating them (as is too often the case) means missing the bigger picture of how AI systems impact both people and the planet. Ethical and sustainable AI development can\u2019t be pursued in isolation. The same choices that affect who benefits or is harmed by AI systems also determine how much energy and resources they consume. We explore how two key concepts, evaluation and transparency, can serve as bridges between these domains: \ud83d\udcca Evaluation, by moving beyond accuracy or performance metrics to include environmental and social costs, as we\u2019ve done with tools like the AI Energy Score. \ud83d\udd0d Transparency, by enabling reproducibility, accountability, and environmental reporting through open tools like the Environmental Transparency Space. AI systems mirror our priorities. If we separate ethics from sustainability, we risk building technologies that are efficient but...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/452837154929545", "date_published": "2025-10-12T09:20:15.354708"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/175050207181959", "image": "", "title": "STOP EVERYTHING NOW - we might finally have a radical architecture improvement over Transformers!!! \ud83d\udea8", "content_text": "STOP EVERYTHING NOW - we might finally have a radical architecture improvement over Transformers!!! \ud83d\udea8 A lone scientist just proposed Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), and it is literally the most impressive model that I've seen this year. \u27a1\ufe0f Tiny Recursive Model is 7M parameters \u27a1\ufe0f On ARC-AGI, it beats flagship models like Gemini-2.5-pro Consider how wild this is: Gemini-2.5-pro must be over 10,000x bigger and had 1,000 as many authors \ud83d\ude02 (Alexia is alone on the paper) What's this sorcery?
