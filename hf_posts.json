Concepts like \u201cagent swarms\u201d were highlighted at the AI Engineer Code Summit in NYC (Nov 20\u201321) as the winning architecture. And this trend is not only about coding and software. It applies across all AI domains. So here is some recent research that helps keep multi-agent systems (MAS) better and up-to-date: 1. LatentMAS \u2192 Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems (2511.20639) AI agents share their hidden \"thoughts\" directly in latent space instead of talking through text. This makes collaboration and reasoning way faster and accurate (no extra training needed) 2. Puppeteer \u2192 Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration (2505.19591) Uses a \u201cpuppeteer\u201d LLM that dynamically decides which agents (\u201cpuppets\u201d) to call and in what order.

Our actions are driven by unspeakable instincts, which left no traces in training set (pretraining or synthetic). These process rewards (motion sensing, vision etc.) help you master new skills quickly, like biking. Outcome reward only (falling off the bike) is indeed too sparse. But lots of tasks can benefit from outcome rewards alone. Many latest RL works to upgrade SQL skills use success-failure reward only, with executable as optional reward. Additionally, scale is the secret sauce for models to surpass humans. A human agent can learn a task quickly, but is capacity limited. But a model agent can process tasks in the scale of many human lifetimes. This made up for the inadequacy of process rewards. Many such tasks happen to be economically viable, i.e. salary-making jobs.
