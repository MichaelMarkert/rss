I just wanted to share something I've been working on lately. This is Continuum, an app that started as a regular chat interface but quickly spiraled into much more! The left panel contains settings, different project workspaces with associated chat sessions, and the model drop down menu. The middle panel is the chat window with engaging color schemes for italics or bold characters. The right panel is the \"Loom\" - a collaborative document workspace for the AI model and the user to work together in markdown with a live preview toggle switch. The Loom supports differential edits allowing the user to reject, approve, or edit each model change/addition. Right now, Continuum will support BYOK, OAI compatible endpoints, and local models served through ollama/llama.cpp It's still very much a work in progress but I'm really happy with how it's coming along so far. I'm excited to share this demo with all of you when it's ready!
