And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce \"LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser\", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. \ud83c\udfaf Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! \ud83e\udde0 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480", "date_published": "2025-06-08T17:18:51.736103"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/887961203876963", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\udce2 Duality's Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Kaggle competition is back!\ud83d\udc4f", "content_text": "\ud83d\udce2 Duality's Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Kaggle competition is back!\ud83d\udc4f Sign up here \u27a1\ufe0f \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/multi-instance-object-detection-challenge/overview This competition will test users' ability to train a model for multi-instance object detection.
