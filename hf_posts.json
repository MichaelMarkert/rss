Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -> InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -> CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -> ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893", "date_published": "2025-04-23T09:25:28.154885"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/aiqtech/339494015180136", "image": "", "title": "\ud83c\udf10 AI Token Visualization Tool with Perfect Multilingual Support", "content_text": "\ud83c\udf10 AI Token Visualization Tool with Perfect Multilingual Support Hello!
