This tutorial covers how to do LoRA training and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth training on Qwen Image models. It covers both the Qwen Image base model and the Qwen Image Edit Plus 2509 model. This tutorial is the product of 21 days of full R&D, costing over $800 in cloud services to find the best configurations for training. Furthermore, we have developed an amazing, ultra-easy-to-use Gradio app to use the legendary Kohya Musubi Tuner trainer with ease. You will be able to train locally on your Windows computer with GPUs with as little as 6 GB of VRAM for both LoRA and Fine-Tuning. Furthermore, I have shown how to train a character (person), a product (perfume) and a style (GTA5 artworks).

I still remember that November well - so much was happening, but GPT-2's release felt like a watershed moment for the field. It showed us what was possible with carefully trained language models. To recreate some of that GPT-2 magic, I recently tackled an interesting challenge: can you pretrain a language model with just 1 billion tokens - roughly 1/10th of what GPT-2 used - and still get comparable performance? After 50+ systematic experiments testing different dataset mixtures, the answer is yes. The result is codelion/gpt-2-70m , which achieves over 90% of GPT-2's benchmark performance despite being trained on 10x less data. The key was finding the optimal dataset composition: 50% high-quality textbook PDFs, 30% filtered web content, and 20% educational resources. It even beats GPT-2 on TruthfulQA (47.31% vs 40.69%).

ToolsGen takes your JSON tool definitions and automatically generates realistic user requests, corresponding tool calls, and evaluates them using an LLM-as-a-judge pipeline. It outputs datasets ready to use with Hugging Face. What makes it useful: - Generates realistic user requests + tool calls from JSON definitions - LLM-as-a-judge quality scoring with multi-dimensional rubrics - Multiple sampling strategies (random, parameter-aware, semantic) - OpenAI-compatible API support - Outputs JSONL with train/val splits Still early days (API isn't stable yet), but it's already helping me generate tool-calling datasets much faster.

The most useful AI applications are moving toward multi-turn agentic behavior: systems that take hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to complete a task, e.g. Claude Code, computer-control agents that click, type, and test repeatedly. In these cases, the power of the model is not how smart it is per token, but in how quickly it can interact with its environment and tools across many steps. In that regime, model quality becomes secondary to latency. An open-source model that can call tools quickly, check that the right thing was clicked, or verify that a code change actually passes tests can easily outperform a slightly \u201csmarter\u201d closed model that has to make remote API calls for every move. Eventually, the balance tips: it becomes impractical for an agent to rely on remote inference for every micro-action.
