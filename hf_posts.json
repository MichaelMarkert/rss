Today, Gradio is used by >1 million developers each month to build and share AI web apps. This includes some of the most popular open-source projects of all time, like Automatic1111, Fooocus, Oobabooga\u2019s Text WebUI, Dall-E Mini, and LLaMA-Factory. How did we get here? How did Gradio keep growing in the very crowded field of open-source Python libraries? I get this question a lot from folks who are building their own open-source libraries. This post distills some of the lessons that I have learned over the past few years: 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level abstractions 2. Embed virality directly into your library 3. Focus on a (growing) niche 4. Your only roadmap should be rapid iteration 5. Maximize ways users can consume your library's outputs 1.
