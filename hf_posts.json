As agents become more autonomous, the real challenge shifts from generation to governance: understanding when, why, and under what constraints an agent should act. At GoDaddy, we\u2019ve been treating context as a first-class primitive for agentic systems \u2014 combining identity, intent, permissions, and environment so agents can operate responsibly in production. Context is what turns automation into judgment. Without it, autonomy becomes risk. This post outlines how we\u2019re thinking about the transition from task execution to context-aware agentic systems, and what that means for building AI that can be trusted at scale. \ud83d\udc49 How we build context for agentic AI: https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/how-godaddy-builds-context-for-agentic-ai Curious how others here are modeling context, trust boundaries, and decision constraints in agentic architectures.
