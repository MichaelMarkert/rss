Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

AI systems need to remember past interactions, update knowledge, stay consistent over time, and work beyond a single prompt. That's why many start to talk more about memory in AI. Here\u2019s a useful set of studies and videos on where AI memory stands today: 1. Memory in the Age of AI Agents (2512.13564) A great survey that organizes agent memory research. It gives concrete taxonomies across memory form, function, and dynamics, summarizes benchmarks, frameworks, and emerging directions for building systematic agent memory systems 2.When Will We Give AI True Memory?

The \"Attractive Metadata Attack\" paper details this stealthy new threat. To measure the real-world impact of their attack, the researchers needed a source of sensitive data for the agent to leak. We're proud that the AI4Privacy corpus was used to create the synthetic user profiles containing standardized PII for their experiments. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helped researchers Kanghua Mo, \u9f99\u6631\u4e1e, Zhihao Li from Guangzhou University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to not just demonstrate a new attack, but also quantify its potential for harm. This data-driven evidence is what pushes the community to build better, execution-level defenses for AI agents. \ud83d\udd17 Check out their paper to see how easily an agent's trust in tool metadata could be exploited: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110 #OpenSource #DataPrivacy #LLM #Anonymization...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/284489022074040", "date_published": "2025-12-31T05:29:29.982237"}]}
