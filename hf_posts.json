Here's what every ML engineer needs to know. \ud83d\udcca Key Findings Across 5 Model Variants (XL to Nano): 1. NPU Dominance in Efficiency: - YOLOv11n: 1.72ms on NPU vs 53.60ms on CPU (31x faster) - Memory footprint: 0-65MB across all variants - Consistent sub-10ms inference even on XL models 2. The Sweet Spot - YOLOv11s: - NPU: 3.23ms @ 95.57% mAP - Perfect balance: 36MB model, production-ready speed - 10x faster than GPU, 30x faster than CPU 3. Surprising Discovery: Medium models (YOLOv11m) show unusual GPU performance patterns - NPU outperforms GPU by 4x (9.55ms vs 35.82ms), suggesting current GPU kernels aren't optimized for mid-size architectures. 4. Production Insights: - XL/Large: GPU still competitive for batch processing - Small/Nano: NPU absolutely crushes everything else - Memory scaling: Linear from 10MB...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/506441566129403", "date_published": "2025-09-26T05:21:51.510591"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/dmoxy/581267174720703", "image": "", "title": "\ud83c\udf1e Our Summer of Workflows finale!
