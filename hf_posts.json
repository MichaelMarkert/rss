Fascinating TED talk by @ thomwolf on open source AI and its future impact. Imagine this for AI: instead of black box models running in distant data centers, we get transparent AI that runs locally on our phones and laptops, often without needing internet access. If the original team moves on? No problem - resilience is one of the beauties of open source. Anyone (companies, collectives, or individuals) can adapt and fix these models. This is a compelling vision of AI's future that solves many of today's concerns around AI transparency and centralized control.

Important steps: Good idea is to start with a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installation with latest CUDA 12.8 and the open NVIDIA driver - follow more advices from [2]: sudo apt -y install cuda-toolkit-12-8 nvidia-open I tried update from an existing Ubuntu installation with an older CUDA and driver version and it resulted in a non-startable system. If you are using PyTorch 2.6 with built CUDA 12.6 it will result in: NVIDIA Graphics Device with CUDA capability sm_120 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation. The current PyTorch install supports CUDA capabilities sm_50 sm_60 sm_70 sm_75 sm_80 sm_86 sm_90. But no worries! For PyTorch you need just to use a nightly 2.7 version...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/stefan-it/989004577410802", "date_published": "2025-03-02T13:21:49.393416"}]}
