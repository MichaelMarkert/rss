This tension is especially visible in conversational systems, where safeguards can sometimes feel more paternalistic than supportive. In my latest piece for Hugging Face, I argue that open source and community-driven approaches offer a promising (though not exclusive) way forward. \u2728 Transparency can make safety mechanisms into learning opportunities. \u2728 Collaboration with diverse communities makes safeguards more relevant across contexts. \u2728 Iteration in the open lets protections evolve rather than freeze into rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Of course, this isn\u2019t a silver bullet. Top-down safety measures will still be necessary in some cases. But if we only rely on corporate control, we risk building systems that are safe at the expense of trust and autonomy.

Here are 12 useful MCP servers that will help you create convenient agentic ecosystems: 1. Chrome DevTools MCP \u2192 https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp Lets your coding agent (Gemini, Claude, Cursor, Copilot) control a live Chrome browser with full DevTools access for automation, debugging, and performance analysis 2. Windows-MCP \u2192 https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP Provides interaction between agents and Windows, handling file navigation, app control, UI actions, QA testing 3. MCPControl \u2192 https://github.com/claude-did-this/MCPControl Windows control server for programmatic control of mouse, keyboard, window management, and screen capture 4. MetaMCP \u2192 https://github.com/metatool-ai/metamcp A proxy that aggregates multiple MCP servers into one, with middleware support.

What makes it special? At Hawky.ai we are started experimenting with Qwen3 recently for Analysis and Optimization. Unlike traditional tools that look at text, images, or audio separately, Qwen3-Omni analyzes everything together. It handles 119 languages, processes 40-minute audio sequences, and understands both images and videos\u2014all at once. The cool part? It's 2-3x faster than similar models thanks to its MoE architecture. Real applications I'm seeing: Ad Analysis: It scores video ads by combining visual elements, audio tone, and text\u2014giving 25% better CTR predictions than single-mode tools.

Probably, you have done it with minimising a KL divergence, and it somehow worked. Well, not that well, right? 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Your model tends to memorise! 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Your model might get the right answer, but its reasoning might be flawed. To fix those problems, we rethink distillation and process a new approach! A method that is based on constrained RL that comes with nice theoretical guarantees and excellent performance!
