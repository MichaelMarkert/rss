Typically, quantizing the LLM to INT4 (unlike say INT8) for inference can incur some accuracy loss. Instead of accepting the quality loss, we used the FP16 model as a teacher to train a tiny LoRA adapter (rank=16) for the quantized model. The cool part: the model generates its own training data using the Magpie technique so no external datasets needed. This is critical because we want to remain as much as possible in the distribution of the model's natural responses. Last year Apple's foundational models paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075 ) had proposed a similar technique and found \"By using accuracy-recovery LoRA adapters with only rank 16, Alpaca win rate can be improved by 7-18%, GMS8K accuracy is boosted by 5-10%.\" (page 47).
