I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation\u2014on just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt\u2013response pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn\u2019t turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands \u201cOh great, another meeting\u201d exactly as you mean it.

The model is built based on SigLIP2-400M and MiniCPM4-3B, with a total of 4.1B parameters. It inherits the strong single-image, multi-image, and video understanding performance of MiniCPM-V 2.6 with largely improved efficiency. \u2728 With only 4.1B parameters, MiniCPM-V 4.0 achieves an average score of 69.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. This performance surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414, MiniCPM-V 2.6 (8.1B parameters, OpenCompass 65.2), and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3.8B parameters, OpenCompass 64.5). It also shows good performance in multi-image and video understanding.
