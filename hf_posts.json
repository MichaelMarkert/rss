JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, a self-supervised learning framework that predicts the latent representation of a missing part of the input. Here are 11 JEPA types that you should know about: 1. V-JEPA 2 -> V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning (2506.09985) Trained on 1M+ hours of internet videos and a little bit of robot interaction data, V-JEPA 2 can watch, understand, answer questions, and help robots plan and act in physical world 2. Time-Series-JEPA (TS-JEPA) -> Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks (2406.04853) It's a time-series predictive model that learns compact, meaningful representations. A self-supervised semantic actor then uses them to generate control commands without raw data 3.

With advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL), machines are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of making decisions autonomously. This shift is having a significant impact on society as we know it. One of the most notable aspects of RL is its ability to learn from experience. By observing and interacting with its surroundings, an AI-driven RL system can adapt to new situations and make decisions based on real-world data. This has huge implications for industries like healthcare, where AI can be used to analyze patient data and provide personalized treatment plans, or finance, where it can help predict market trends and make more informed investment decisions. Furthermore, RL is driving innovation in robotics and automation. Autonomous vehicles, for example, rely on RL to navigate complex environments safely...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ghostai1/378992241286931", "date_published": "2025-06-18T09:26:55.583578"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/393069420654961", "image": "", "title": "Congrats to the top trending dataset", "content_text": "Congrats to the top trending dataset institutional/institutional-books-1.0 !
