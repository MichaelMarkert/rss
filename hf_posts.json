It doesn't update the full model, it adds small trainable components, low-rank matrices, while keeping the original weights frozen. Only these adapters are trained. Recently, many interesting new LoRA variations came out, so it\u2019s a great time to take a look at these 13 clever approaches: 1. T-LoRA \u2192 T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting (2507.05964) A timestep-dependent LoRA method for adapting diffusion models with a single image. It dynamically adjusts updates and uses orthogonal initialization to reduce overlap, achieving better fidelity\u2013alignment balance than standard LoRA 2. SingLoRA \u2192 SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix (2507.05566) Simplifies LoRA by using only one small matrix instead of usual two, and multiplying it by its own transpose (like A \u00d7 A\u1d40).
