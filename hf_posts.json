Real security is about layers.", "content_text": "A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers. The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, \"Whispered Tuning\", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. \ud83d\udd17 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 \ud83d\ude80 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI\u2014follow us on LinkedIn:...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311", "date_published": "2026-02-03T14:06:34.986239"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/695215283251750", "image": "", "title": "Experimental global target bits\u2011per\u2011weight quantization of mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512 and mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512", "content_text": "Experimental global target bits\u2011per\u2011weight quantization of mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512 and mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512 Unlike standard llama.cpp quantizations that rely on fixed type heuristics (e.g., Q4_K_M), the Target BPW approach optimizes per-tensor precision where it matters the most, and produces high quality models that meet a precise global file size target. Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

The goal of this project is to build a decision-support tool for recruiters that doesn\u2019t just \u201csound confident,\u201d but can actually explain why it produces a given recommendation. Link: 19arjun89/AI_Recruiting_Agent Over the last few iterations, I\u2019ve focused on three areas: 1) Deterministic Verification of Job Requirements (Skills) Previously, required skills were extracted by an LLM from the job description. While this worked well, it still relied heavily on model behavior. I\u2019ve now added a verification layer that: Requires every \u201crequired\u201d skill to be backed by a verbatim quote from the job description This means hallucinated skills are explicitly detected and removed before scoring.
