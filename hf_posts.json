Most models are Heretic'ed (uncensored) first, and tuned second. This vastly improves the model. Models are also bench marked and in almost all cases exceed org model metrics - and in some cases by a lot.

NoesisLab/Spartacus-1B-Instruct We have successfully replaced the KV-cache bottleneck inherent in Softmax Attention with Causal Monoid State Compression. By defining the causal history as a monoid recurrence, , the entire prefix is lossily compressed into a fixed-size state matrix per head. The technical core of this architecture relies on the associativity of the monoid operator: Training: parallel prefix scan using Triton-accelerated JIT kernels to compute all prefix states simultaneously. Inference: True sequential updates. Memory and time complexity per token are decoupled from sequence length. Explicit Causality: We discard RoPE and attention masks. Causality is a first-class citizen, explicitly modeled through learned, content-dependent decay gates. Current zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that Spartacus-1B-Instruct (1.3B) is already outperforming established sub-quadratic models like Mamba-1.4B and...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/OzTianlu/866420978580038", "date_published": "2026-02-18T09:55:34.862722"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/demirytu/616984337971296", "image": "", "title": "is the chat feature down? recently I can not have success to get responses for my prompts.", "content_text": "is the chat feature down? recently I can not have success to get responses for my prompts.
