A few take-aways stood out - especially for those interested in local deployment and performance trade-offs: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (via Fireworks API) tops the table at **83.66%** with ~55 tok/s. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 But the **30B-A3B Unsloth** quant delivered **82.20%** while running locally at ~45 tok/s and with zero API spend. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 The same Unsloth build is ~5x faster than Qwen's **Qwen3-32B**, which scores **82.20%** as well yet crawls at <10 tok/s. 4\ufe0f\u20e3 On Apple silicon, the **30B MLX** port hits **79.51%** while sustaining ~64 tok/s - arguably today's best speed/quality trade-off for Mac setups. 5\ufe0f\u20e3 The **0.6B** micro-model races above 180 tok/s but tops out at **37.56%** - that's why it's not even on the graph (50 % performance cut-off). All local runs were done with LM Studio on an M4 MacBook Pro, using Qwen's official recommended settings....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/wolfram/819510719695955", "date_published": "2025-05-11T05:21:32.064660"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/347153743407715", "image": "", "title": "I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! \ud83d\udcaa", "content_text": "I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! \ud83d\udcaa The app's workflow is simple. Given a source PDF or URL, it extracts the content from it, then tasks Meta's Llama 3.3-70B with writing the podcast script, with a good prompt crafted by @ gabrielchua (\"two hosts, with lively discussion, fun notes, insightful question etc.\") Then it hands off the text-to-speech conversion to Kokoro-82M, and there you go, you have two hosts discussion any article. The generation is nearly instant, because: > Llama 3.3 70B is running at 1,000 tokens/seconds with Cerebras inference > The audio is generated in streaming mode by the tiny (yet powerful) Kokoro, generating voices faster than real-time. And the audio generation runs for free on Zero GPUs, hosted by HF on H200s. Overall, open source solutions rival the quality of closed-source solutions at close to no cost!
