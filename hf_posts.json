This caching eliminates the need for real-time retrieval during inference, reducing token usage by up to 76% while maintaining answer quality. CAG is particularly effective for constrained knowledge bases like internal documentation, FAQs, and customer support systems, where all relevant information can fit within the model's extended context window. #rag #retrievalaugmentedgeneration See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/762624768908636", "date_published": "2025-11-16T13:27:17.506281"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/695072229497754", "image": "", "title": "Next level Realism with Qwen Image is now possible after new realism LoRA workflow - Top images are new realism workflow - Bottom ones are older default - Full tutorial published - 4+4 Steps only", "content_text": "Next level Realism with Qwen Image is now possible after new realism LoRA workflow - Top images are new realism workflow - Bottom ones are older default - Full tutorial published - 4+4 Steps only Tutorial of realism : https://youtu.be/XWzZ2wnzNuQ Tutorial of training : https://youtu.be/DPX3eBTuO_Y This is a full comprehensive step-by-step tutorial for how to train Qwen Image models. This tutorial covers how to do LoRA training and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth training on Qwen Image models. It covers both the Qwen Image base model and the Qwen Image Edit Plus 2509 model. This tutorial is the product of 21 days of full R&D, costing over $800 in cloud services to find the best configurations for training. Furthermore, we have developed an amazing, ultra-easy-to-use Gradio app to use the legendary Kohya Musubi Tuner trainer with ease. You will be able to train locally on your Windows computer with GPUs with as little as 6 GB of VRAM for both LoRA and Fine-Tuning.

This year has been wild. Vision Language Models like Nanonets OCR2-3B hit the scene and suddenly we're getting accuracy on complex forms (vs for traditional OCR). We're talking handwritten checkboxes, watermarked documents, multi-column layouts, even LaTeX equations all handled in a single pass.\u200b The market numbers say it all: OCR accuracy passed 98% for printed text, AI integration is everywhere, and real-time processing is now standard. The entire OCR market is hitting $25.13 billion in 2025 because this tech actually works now. I wrote a detailed Medium article walking through: 1. Why vision LMs changed the game 2.

For e-commerce work, though, we can start with the Web Data Commons (WDC), the project by the University of Mannheim. It extracts web pages that carry some metadata and publishes the result as the Large-Scale Product Corpus (LSPC). Search engines like Google reward pages that include detailed product markup, so merchants already populate their sites with SEO-friendly fields such as title, brand, GTIN, price \u2014 and, crucially, category labels. Thanks to these built-in annotations, the WDC Large-Scale Product Corpus arrives almost fully self-labelled.
