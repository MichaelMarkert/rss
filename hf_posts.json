If you\u2019re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It\u2019s not perfect yet \u2014 I\u2019ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it\u2019s a promising start.

Recent RL paradigms often relied on a set of questions an answers that needs to be manually curated. Researchers from Tsinghua University went like \"why though\". \ud83e\udd14 Indeed, why learn from question designed by a human teacher, when the model can start from their base knowledge and learn by experimenting in a code environment, proposing coding tasks themselves and trying to solve them? Thus they created \u201cAbsolute Zero Reasoning\u201d (AZR), an approach that removes any need for human curated data. \ud83c\udfad \ud835\uddd7\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00: \u2023 Proposer: Generates challenging but solvable coding tasks \u2023 Solver: Attempts to solve those self-proposed tasks \ud83e\uddea \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00: all types are defined as triplets of program, input and output \u2023 Deduction: Give model an input and program, it must deduce the output \u2023 Abduction: Give model an program and output, it must find the input that gave said output \u2023 Induction: Synthesize a...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/402808163323191", "date_published": "2025-05-15T09:25:49.310245"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/683112818630492", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 VisionScout Now Speaks More Like Me \u2014 Thanks to LLMs!", "content_text": "\ud83d\ude80 VisionScout Now Speaks More Like Me \u2014 Thanks to LLMs! I'm thrilled to share a major update to VisionScout, my end-to-end vision system. Beyond robust object detection (YOLOv8) and semantic context (CLIP), VisionScout now features a powerful LLM-based scene narrator (Llama 3.2), improving the clarity, accuracy, and fluidity of scene understanding. This isn\u2019t about replacing the pipeline , it\u2019s about giving it a better voice. \u2728 \u2b50\ufe0f What the LLM Brings Fluent, Natural Descriptions: The LLM transforms structured outputs into human-readable narratives. Smarter Contextual Flow: It weaves lighting, objects, zones, and insights into a unified story. Grounded Expression: Carefully prompt-engineered to stay factual \u2014 it enhances, not hallucinates. Helpful Discrepancy Handling: When YOLO and CLIP diverge, the LLM adds clarity through reasoning.
