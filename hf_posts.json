This third-generation model, succeeding Veo 2, introduces groundbreaking features, most notably its ability to generate high-quality videos with integrated audio, including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise.

This was done long ago and got into CVPR25 -- super excited to finally share it now, along with the data and code \u2665\ufe0f We explore several architectural choices that affect this design. We provide an open & reproducible training recipe that works at scale. Works like Playground v3 have already explored a deep fusion between an LLM and a DiT, sharing their representations through layerwise attention. They exhibit excellent performance on T2I. Despite its compelling results and other performance virtues, it remains unexplored, which is what we want to improve in our work. Specifically, we take a pre-trained LLM (Gemma-2B) and trainable DiT, and set out to explore what makes a \"good deep fusion\" between the two for T2I. We explore several key questions in the work, such as: Q1: How should we do attention? We considered several alternatives.
