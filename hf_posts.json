Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu \u2192 https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09223 Many recommend this 270-page book as a good resource to focus on fundamental concepts, such as pre-training, generative models, prompting, alignment, and inference 2.

And my personal favorite so far - I adore peak performance at small/nano scale. Everyone deserves to run/train AGI locally:) our data, our god model! They showed that: - you can train LLMs (upto 1B params) with as low as batch_size=1. This is unconventional given small batch sizes can lead to unstable/spiky training runs. - you can have a stable train run with just vanilla SGD(stochastic gradient descent), no momentum required\ud83e\udd2f - small batch sizes are more robust to hyperparameters (i.e no worries with initialization) - smaller batch sizes outperforms (\u201cbetter per-Flops performance\u201d) larger batch sizes. \u201cWe recommend that practitioners training large models in memory-constrained settings exploit the benefits of small batch sizes rather than trying to emulate the large batch size setting (e.g., through gradient accumulation) typically used in industry.\u201d I\u2019ve been doing this for ages - my mantra: all my experiments must scale on...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/640818601212021", "date_published": "2025-07-21T13:41:51.581159"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/erikkaum/383373646875765", "image": "", "title": "ZML just released a technical preview of their new Inference Engine: LLMD.", "content_text": "ZML just released a technical preview of their new Inference Engine: LLMD. - Just 2.4GB container, which means fast startup times and efficient autoscaling - Cross-Platform GPU Support: works on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. - written in Zig I just tried it out and deployed it on Hugging Face Inference Endpoints and wrote a quick guide \ud83d\udc47 You can try it in like 5 minutes! https://huggingface.co/blog/erikkaum/test-driving-llmd-inference-engine See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/erikkaum/383373646875765", "date_published": "2025-07-21T13:41:51.581451"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/270501016622467", "image": "", "title": "All you need is curation", "content_text": "All you need is curation See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/270501016622467", "date_published": "2025-07-21T13:41:51.581632"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/135737241770101", "image": "", "title": "AudioRAG is becoming real!

Thrilled to share insights from my recent interview with MIT Technology Review about the growing movement toward local LLMs and what it means for AI democratization.

Our conversations become training data, our personal stories get \"cooked into\" models, and our privacy becomes a commodity. But there's an alternative path forward. \ud83d\udca1 The power shift is real: Local LLMs aren't just about privacy; they're about redistributing AI power away from a handful of tech giants. When individuals, organizations, and even entire nations can run their own models, we're democratizing access to AI capabilities. \ud83e\udd17 At Hugging Face, we're proud to be at the center of this transformation.
