So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI\u2019s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf <resource> <action>. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember?
