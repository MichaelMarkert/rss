Real security is about layers.", "content_text": "A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers. The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, \"Whispered Tuning\", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. \ud83d\udd17 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 \ud83d\ude80 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI\u2014follow us on LinkedIn:...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311", "date_published": "2026-02-04T05:53:15.933201"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/790273915312125", "image": "", "title": "The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena.", "content_text": "The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena. \ud83c\udfc6 The Champions: Claude-Opus-4.5, Gemini-3-Pro, GPT-5.2, and Gemini-3-Flash sweep the top four spots. \ud83d\ude80 The Pursuers: Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.2 tie for first place among Chinese models; GLM-4.7, ERNIE-5.0, and Kimi secure their positions in the domestic top five. \ud83d\udd25 The Biggest Highlight: The top three spots on the open-source leaderboard are entirely held by Team China (DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), outperforming the best western open-source models.

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

Link: 19arjun89/AI_Recruiting_Agent Over the last few iterations, I\u2019ve focused on three areas: 1) Deterministic Verification of Job Requirements (Skills) Previously, required skills were extracted by an LLM from the job description. While this worked well, it still relied heavily on model behavior. I\u2019ve now added a verification layer that: Requires every \u201crequired\u201d skill to be backed by a verbatim quote from the job description This means hallucinated skills are explicitly detected and removed before scoring.
