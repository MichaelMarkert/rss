Just tested it with Steve Jobs' Stanford speech and was speechless (pun intended). The video isn\u2019t sped up. 3 things that floored me: - Transcription took just 10 seconds for a 15-min file - Got a CSV with perfect timestamps, punctuation & capitalization - Stunning accuracy (correctly captured \"Reed College\" and other specifics) NVIDIA also released a demo where you can click any transcribed segment to play it instantly. The improvement is significant: number 1 on the ASR Leaderboard, 6% error rate (best in class) with complete commercial freedom (cc-by-4.0 license). Time to update those Whisper pipelines!

But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today. Here's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches: 1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -> Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (2504.20769) Provides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs 2. Hybrid-CoT -> AdaR1: From Long-CoT to Hybrid-CoT via Bi-Level Adaptive Reasoning Optimization (2504.21659) Proposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles 3.
