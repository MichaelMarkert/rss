I would be grateful if you could check it and upvote on HuggingFace Daily Papers - Reactive Transformer (RxT) -- Stateful Real-Time Processing for Event-Driven Reactive Language Models (2510.03561) Architecture is based on stateful real-time processing with innovational asynchronous memory update. Instead of reprocessing all the conversation history for each message, it's processing only single query with all the context moved to dedicated memory layers. Memory is updated after generating the answer, so it's not influencing latency - in tests, time to first token was almost the same as generating a single token. It has also better quality/accuracy in multi-turn dialogue than the same size stateless decoder-only model. Initial experiments were small scale (12M to 160M params models trained on simple synthetic datasets), but just now I'm starting training of bigger 270M params model on...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdamF92/854077189361039", "date_published": "2025-10-09T05:22:13.253097"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/886559259732378", "image": "", "title": "Have built the new Image Studio with the Gemini Image Gen models for the following multiple tasks:", "content_text": "Have built the new Image Studio with the Gemini Image Gen models for the following multiple tasks: imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001 model for Image Generation (Text-to-Image) and Multi-Image Editing (Image-to-Image), and Draw-to-Image powered by gemini-2.5-flash-image (aka Nano Banana). \u2b50 Gemini-Image-Studio: prithivMLmods/Gemini-Image-Studio (Latest) \ud83e\udd1e Old-App: prithivMLmods/Nano-Banana-AIO \ud83e\udd4a GitHub: https://github.com/prithivsakthiur/gemini-image-studio-hf To proceed, you need to add your Gemini API key.
