The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/\u03b5\u00b2) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, \u03b5 = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/\u03b5) examples (where d = input...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125", "date_published": "2025-06-16T05:25:51.869378"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/740369227920658", "image": "", "title": "You can now edit operations with a discrete flow model, supercool\ud83d\udc4d!
