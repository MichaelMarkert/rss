When OpenAI released its Computer-Using Agent (CUA) API, I happened to be playing Wordle \ud83e\udde9 and thought, why not see how the model handles it? Spoiler: Wordle turned out to be a surprisingly effective benchmark. So Romain Cosentino Ph.D. and I dug in and analyzed the results of several hundred runs. \ud83d\udd11 Takeaways 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Even the best computer-using models struggle with simple, context-dependent tasks. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Visual perception and reasoning remain major hurdles for multimodal agents. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Real-world use cases reveal significant gaps between hype and reality.

The panelists are managers/directors of Fortune 500 companies. These people make things happen and own results, so their stories and pain points are fresh. (1) Models are used EVERYWHERE, customer facing and internal support, etc. (2) A successful application must improve one of the following: revenue (\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5), cost (\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5), CSAT (still \ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5) (3) They proactively search on \ud83e\udd17HF\ud83e\udd17 for models and use them. Open source models (especially small ones) can flexibly fit into their existing workflows/infras, which enable them to deliver, and fast. (4) The main barrier for adoption is license. A director told me they picked a model and finetuned it, then learned they would have to share enhancements. As a result, they dropped this model and the million dollar impact went to another model. So to fellow model builders: (1) celebrate that our work is useful and generate lots of values (2) make your license permissive if you want maximum impact See...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/992154552707771", "date_published": "2025-04-25T17:19:18.021573"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/victor/207569978315745", "image": "", "title": "DIA TTS is just amazing - please share your funniest gens (here is mine) \ud83d\ude02", "content_text": "DIA TTS is just amazing - please share your funniest gens (here is mine) \ud83d\ude02 nari-labs/Dia-1.6B See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/victor/207569978315745", "date_published": "2025-04-25T17:19:18.021796"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/857345172218118", "image": "", "title": "New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning", "content_text": "New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning \u201cwe propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end.
