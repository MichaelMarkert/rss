According to the datasheet: - Rated speed: 0.133 s per 60\u00b0 Calculation: - 0.133 s \u00d7 6 = 0.798 s per full rotation - 1 / 0.798 = 1.253 revolutions per second - 1.253 \u00d7 60 = 75.2 RPM This confirms the official specification of approximately 75 RPM at 12 V under no load. Our measurement: - Encoder output: 5,300 values per second - Encoder resolution: 4,096 counts per revolution Calculation: - Revolutions per second = 5,300 \u00f7 4,096 = 1.294 rev/s - RPM = 1.294 \u00d7 60 = 77.6 RPM Result: The measured value differs by only about 2\u20133% from the datasheet specification, confirming that the STS3250 performs very close to its rated no-load speed. This close agreement validates both the servo\u2019s performance and our measurement approach.
