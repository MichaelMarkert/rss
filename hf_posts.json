Here are 9 fresh policy optimization techniques worth knowing: 1. GSPO: Group Sequence Policy Optimization \u2192 Group Sequence Policy Optimization (2507.18071) Shifts from token-level to sequence-level optimization, clipping, and rewarding to capture the full picture and increase stability compared to GRPO. GSPO-token variation also allows token-level fine-tuning. 2. LAPO: Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization \u2192 LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (2507.15758) A two-stage RL framework that trains models to adaptively control reasoning length by learning typical solution lengths for shorter and more efficient reasoning. 3.

So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI\u2019s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf <resource> <action>. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember?

AI's all about the data! \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcda) The impact of the template will depend on how effectively it establishes a minimum meaningful transparency standard for companies that don't otherwise offer any transparency into their handling of e.g. personal data or (anti?-)competitive practices in commercial licensing - we'll see how those play out as new models are released after August 2nd \ud83d\udc40 In the meantime, I wanted to see how the template works for a fully open-source + commercially viable model, so I filled it out for the SmolLM3 - which my colleagues at Hugging Face earlier this month \ud83e\udd17 ICYMI, it's fully open-source with 3B parameters and performance matching the best similar-size models (I've switched all my local apps from Qwen3 to it, you should...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/544574162514620", "date_published": "2025-07-29T09:31:23.229435"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\udd2f 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license", "content_text": "\ud83e\udd2f 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license internlm/Intern-S1 internlm released Intern-S1: multimodal reasoning model based on 235B MoE Qwen3 and 6B InternViT \ud83d\ude0d benchmarks look great (\ud83d\udc51 best model \u2705 best open model) See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336", "date_published": "2025-07-29T09:31:23.229677"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/579222924328271", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\udce2 For those who planning to start a PhD or research in the UK \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (including AI field in particular) but facing ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme) issues.", "content_text": "\ud83d\udce2 For those who planning to start a PhD or research in the UK \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (including AI field in particular) but facing ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme) issues.
