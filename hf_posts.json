It really brings back memories of the good old days when we used to flex our custom PC specs on enthusiast forums 20 years ago! That inspired me to fill out my own profile and share it here. And this is my first set of GPUs that I am using to learn MLOps: - RTX 3090 \u2013 the best one; unfortunately it doesn't support the latest FP8 and FP4, but it\u2019s still very powerful. - Tesla V100 \u2013 performance is almost like the RTX 3090, just much older. - Tesla P100 \u2013 old, and doesn't have tensor cores, but still can handle small models. - Radeon MI50 \u2013 old, similar to the P100, but uses ROCm instead of CUDA, which is actually a pretty good experience to setup. - GTX 1080 Ti \u2013 mostly useless, no FP16 support. - GTX 1660 \u2013 first generation of the Turing architecture, but mostly useless. llmlaba See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/kostakoff/295634314130096", "date_published": "2026-02-22T09:36:52.395037"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/100967030465591", "image": "", "title": "Try the demo for Qwen3-VL-abliterated-MAX-Fast:", "content_text": "Try the demo for Qwen3-VL-abliterated-MAX-Fast: prithivMLmods/Qwen3-VL-abliterated-MAX-Fast (Unredacted: Ask Anything with Near-Zero Refusal Rates).

Our key takeaways are: 1. Embedding models, not generative models, are the primary driver of RAG accuracy. Switching from a general-purpose embedder like OpenAI's Text Embedding 3 Large to a legal domain embedder like Isaacus' Kanon 2 Embedder can raise accuracy by ~19 points. 2. Hallucinations are often triggered by retrieval failures. Fix your retrieval stack, and, in most cases, you end up fixing hallucinations. 3. Once you have a solid legal retrieval engine like Kanon 2 Embedder, it doesn\u2019t matter as much what generative model you use; GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3.1 Pro perform relatively similarly, with Gemini 3.1 Pro achieving slightly better accuracy at the cost of more hallucinations. 4. Google's latest LLM, Gemini 3.1 Pro, is actually a bit worse than its predecessor at legal RAG, achieving 79.3%...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/969492302070598", "date_published": "2026-02-22T09:36:52.396447"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/571719932509243", "image": "", "title": "SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro is now V2.1 and massive improvements has arrived", "content_text": "SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro is now V2.1 and massive improvements has arrived Check all below screenshots to see all amazing features 20 Feburary 2026 Update V2.1 This is a pretty big update We have 100% changed the FlashVSR+ backend to a new repo and I have significantly upgraded this repo The new FlashVSR+ works amazing and I think it is better than SeedVR2 for high res videos upscale like upscaling 720p into higher resolution Top menu navigation bar updated into a better version and view FlashVSR+ tab remade and all the features are now working For lower VRAM a button is added which you can use if you get OOM Read the updated UI to understand how to use FlashVSR+ now can upscale images very well as well Image Based GAN upscalers tab also improved and some bugs fixed Output & Comparison tab Video Output was not working properly and this issue fix fixed In Output & Comparison tab, new multi video and multi image comparison sliders added which is super useful to...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/571719932509243", "date_published": "2026-02-22T09:36:52.396912"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/447737809841955", "image": "", "title": "My USB charger has a Blackwell GPU and 128GB RAM.", "content_text": "My USB charger has a Blackwell GPU and 128GB RAM.
