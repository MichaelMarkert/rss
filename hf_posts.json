Here are 9 fresh policy optimization techniques worth knowing: 1. GSPO: Group Sequence Policy Optimization \u2192 Group Sequence Policy Optimization (2507.18071) Shifts from token-level to sequence-level optimization, clipping, and rewarding to capture the full picture and increase stability compared to GRPO. GSPO-token variation also allows token-level fine-tuning. 2. LAPO: Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization \u2192 LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (2507.15758) A two-stage RL framework that trains models to adaptively control reasoning length by learning typical solution lengths for shorter and more efficient reasoning. 3.

AI's all about the data! \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcda) The impact of the template will depend on how effectively it establishes a minimum meaningful transparency standard for companies that don't otherwise offer any transparency into their handling of e.g. personal data or (anti?-)competitive practices in commercial licensing - we'll see how those play out as new models are released after August 2nd \ud83d\udc40 In the meantime, I wanted to see how the template works for a fully open-source + commercially viable model, so I filled it out for the SmolLM3 - which my colleagues at Hugging Face earlier this month \ud83e\udd17 ICYMI, it's fully open-source with 3B parameters and performance matching the best similar-size models (I've switched all my local apps from Qwen3 to it, you should...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/544574162514620", "date_published": "2025-07-29T13:44:25.830706"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/228428153197540", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f At Ai4Privacy, our goal is to empower researchers to build a safer AI ecosystem.

Today, we're highlighting crucial research that does just that by exposing a new vulnerability. The paper \"Forget to Flourish\" details a new model poisoning technique. It's a reminder that as we fine-tune LLMs, our anonymization and privacy strategies must evolve to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy dataset was instrumental in this study. It served two key purposes: Provided a Realistic Testbed: It gave the researchers access to a diverse set of synthetic and realistic PII samples in a safe, controlled environment. Enabled Impactful Benchmarking: It allowed them to measure the actual effectiveness of their data extraction attack, proving it could compromise specific, high-value information.

So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI\u2019s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf <resource> <action>.
