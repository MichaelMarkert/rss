This field is evolving quickly, moving far beyond classics like PPO and GRPO. So here is our overview of 10 newest PO methods: 1. Pref-GRPO \u2192 Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning (2508.20751) Stabilizes text-to-image reinforcement learning (RL) with pairwise preference rewards and a unified UNIGENBENCH benchmark 2. PVPO (Policy with Value Preference Optimization) \u2192 PVPO: Pre-Estimated Value-Based Policy Optimization for Agentic Reasoning (2508.21104) This critic-free RL method uses a pre-trained model as a reference anchor to reduce bias and guide learning, selecting high-value examples through data pre-sampling 3.
