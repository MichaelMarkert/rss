These models achieve 93% average accuracy across enterprise use cases like email routing, fraud detection, document classification, and support ticket categorization. Built on ModernBERT with prototype memory and elastic weight consolidation. Key benefits: 90% cost reduction vs API solutions, 90-120ms local inference, dynamic class addition, and zero vendor lock-in. All models available under adaptive-classifier organization. Install with pip install adaptive-classifier.
