I am currently setting up a trainer and will release the process on how to condition David to behave. This isn't the easiest process, but it's necessary to run David on a curriculum rather than simply feeding the model with cross-entropy and hoping for the best. David's internals involve a clock mechanism that allows direct control of David's freeze/unfreeze mechanisms at runtime - allowing for many opinions to be generated simultaneously. David is multiple models in one, not just one - and yet David is single-shot oriented.
