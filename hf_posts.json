System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. \ud83d\ude80 How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. \ud83d\udcca Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% \u2192 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% \u2192 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% \u2192 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. \u2728 Key benefits: \ud83d\udd04 Cumulative learning over time \ud83d\udcd6 Transparent, inspectable strategies \ud83d\udd0c Works with any OpenAI-compatible API \u26a1 Simple integration: just add \"spl-\" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm.

App-Use lets you scope agents to just the apps they need. Instead of full desktop access, say \"only work with Safari and Notes\" or \"just control iPhone Mirroring\" - visual isolation without new processes for perfectly focused automation. Running computer-use on the entire desktop often causes agent hallucinations and loss of focus when they see irrelevant windows and UI elements. App-Use solves this by creating composited views where agents only see what matters, dramatically improving task completion accuracy What you can build: Research agents working in Safari while writing agents draft in Notes, iPhone automation for messages and reminders, parallel testing across isolated app sessions, or teams of specialized agents working simultaneously without interference. Currently macOS-only (Quartz compositing engine).

In this tutorial video I will show you how to use the most powerful video generation model Wan 2.1 with CausVid LoRA effortlessly. Normally, Wan 2.1 requires 50 steps to get excellent results. With CausiVid LoRA we get such excellent results only in 8 steps. Morever, with newest version 2, now the quality is almost identical to base Wan 2.1. I will show how to download and use in SwarmUI with 1-click to apply download and apply presets. We will also leverage of ComfyUI and fastest attention (Sage Attention). \ud83d\udd17Follow below link to download the zip file that contains SwarmUI installer and AI models downloader Gradio App - the one used in the tutorial \u2935\ufe0f \u25b6\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/posts/SwarmUI-Installer-AI-Videos-Downloader-114517862 \u25b6\ufe0f CausVid Main Tutorial :...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/937623008756207", "date_published": "2025-06-03T13:36:31.823099"}]}
