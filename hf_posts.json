But can they follow the story?\ud83e\udd14 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!\u23f3 We test three skills that matter for real-world use: \ud83d\udd0e Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. \ud83e\udde9 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. \ud83c\udfc3 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging.
