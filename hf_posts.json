Key insight: treating each key as a single token enables perfect retrieval at unlimited context lengths. The article covers: - How HashHop works and why its perfect accuracy is suspicious - Building a tokenized solver that achieves 100% accuracy - Scaling to MALM for real code search tasks - Why this approach could handle 100M+ tokens Read the full article: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/reverse-engineering-magic-hashhop Try the model: codelion/malm-165m Code: https://github.com/codelion/hash-hop See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/260857666290873", "date_published": "2026-01-25T09:27:27.288261"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/703555138750194", "image": "", "title": "After 2 months of refinement, I'm happy to announce that a lot of Transformers' modeling code is now significantly more torch-compile & export-friendly \ud83d\udd25", "content_text": "After 2 months of refinement, I'm happy to announce that a lot of Transformers' modeling code is now significantly more torch-compile & export-friendly \ud83d\udd25 Why it had to be done \ud83d\udc47 PyTorch's Dynamo compiler is increasingly becoming the default interoperability layer for ML systems.
