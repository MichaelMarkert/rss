This allows the training from this data to transfer into real-world applicability \ud83d\udca0 The simulation software, called FalconEditor, can easily create thousands of images with varying lighting, posing, occlusions, backgrounds, camera positions, and more. This enables robust model training. \ud83d\udca0 The labels are created along with the data.

Answering questions like, \u2018what is a reward?\u2019 and \u2018how do we create an environment for a language model?\u2019 - Then it focuses on Deepseek R1 by walking through the paper and highlighting key aspects. This is an old school way to learn ML topics, but it always works. - Next, it takes to you Transformers Reinforcement Learning and demonstrates potential reward functions you could use. This is cool because it uses Marimo notebooks to visualise the reward. - Finally, Maxime walks us through a real training notebook that uses GRPO to reduce generation length. I\u2019m really into this because it works and Maxime took the time to validate it share assets and logging from his own runs for you to compare with....", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/281561952705692", "date_published": "2025-03-06T17:19:00.857134"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/245501501333845", "image": "", "title": "Qilin \ud83d\udd25a large scale multimodal dataset for search, recommendation and RAG research, released by Xiaohongshu & Tsinghua University", "content_text": "Qilin \ud83d\udd25a large scale multimodal dataset for search, recommendation and RAG research, released by Xiaohongshu & Tsinghua University Dataset: THUIR/Qilin Paper: Qilin: A Multimodal Information Retrieval Dataset with APP-level User Sessions (2503.00501) \u2728Multiple content modalities (text, images, video thumbnails) \u2728Rich user interaction data ( from Xiaohongshu\u2019s 300M+ MAUs, 70%+ search penetration) \u2728Comprehensive evaluation metrics \u2728Support for RAG system development See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/245501501333845", "date_published": "2025-03-06T17:19:00.857465"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928", "image": "", "title": "New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP", "content_text": "New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP Source : https://www.patreon.com/posts/123105403 Tutorial video : https://youtu.be/hnAhveNy-8s Please checkout the screenshots See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928", "date_published": "2025-03-06T17:19:00.857704"}]}
