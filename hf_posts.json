Just released **OpenEvolve** - an open-source implementation of Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve system. It's an evolutionary coding agent that uses LLMs to discover and optimize algorithms. I successfully replicated DeepMind's results on circle packing (99.97% match!) and evolved a random search into a simulated annealing algorithm. \u2728 Key features: - Evolves entire codebases (not just single functions) - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API - LLM ensemble approach for better results - Multi-objective optimization \ud83d\udc49 Check it out: GitHub: https://github.com/codelion/openevolve Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/openevolve Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about it!

This was done long ago and got into CVPR25 -- super excited to finally share it now, along with the data and code \u2665\ufe0f We explore several architectural choices that affect this design. We provide an open & reproducible training recipe that works at scale. Works like Playground v3 have already explored a deep fusion between an LLM and a DiT, sharing their representations through layerwise attention. They exhibit excellent performance on T2I. Despite its compelling results and other performance virtues, it remains unexplored, which is what we want to improve in our work. Specifically, we take a pre-trained LLM (Gemma-2B) and trainable DiT, and set out to explore what makes a \"good deep fusion\" between the two for T2I. We explore several key questions in the work, such as: Q1: How should we do attention? We considered several alternatives.
