The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. \ud83d\udc65 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li \ud83d\udcc5 Conference: ICCV, 19 \u2013 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83d\udcc4 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) \ud83d\udcc1 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM \ud83d\ude80 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers \ud83d\ude80 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md \ud83d\udcda More...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420", "date_published": "2025-10-27T09:29:12.907701"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/949505421454376", "image": "", "title": "I\u2019m just reading that Ryzen AI 395 has to be 30% slower than DGX Spark in LLM inferencing\u2026 and only 96GB GPU RAM\u2026 good I haven\u2019t RTFM upfront, so I made the AMD faster with 128GB unified RAM \ud83e\udee1", "content_text": "I\u2019m just reading that Ryzen AI 395 has to be 30% slower than DGX Spark in LLM inferencing\u2026 and only 96GB GPU RAM\u2026 good I haven\u2019t RTFM upfront, so I made the AMD faster with 128GB unified RAM \ud83e\udee1 Z2 mini G1a can run Qwen3 Coder 30B BF16 at 26.8 tok/sec in ~60GB GPU RAM See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/949505421454376", "date_published": "2025-10-27T09:29:12.907959"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/mike-ravkine/114687779852365", "image": "", "title": "Spatial reasoning is a domain where LLMs struggle surprisingly hard.", "content_text": "Spatial reasoning is a domain where LLMs struggle surprisingly hard.

But this provocative article provoked the community quite a bit. The case in point is Claude Code, which happens to be my biggest productivity revolution since ChatGPT. RAG predated TUI and agents. So to be fair it's quite an achievement to survive the AI evolution. But I feel it is overshadowed by context engineering in the agent era.
