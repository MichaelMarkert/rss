Here are my notes on it:", "content_text": "Kimi K2 tech report is full of gems as always. Here are my notes on it: > MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) > Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. > They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 \"first dense\" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992", "date_published": "2025-07-23T13:41:22.898212"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/MaziyarPanahi/751516664507693", "image": "", "title": "\ud83e\uddec Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face \ud83d\udd2c", "content_text": "\ud83e\uddec Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face \ud83d\udd2c OpenMed is back! \ud83d\udd25 Finding the right biomedical NER model just became as precise as a PCR assay!
