What excites me most is its newly launched image editing and multi-image fusion capabilities its semantic understanding is rock-solid this Instruct-following capability basically enables one-sentence end-to-end workflows, delivering a dimensionality-reducing boost in efficiency. Frankly, it nails the pain points of frontline creators: old photo restoration, text modification, even extracting people from multiple images to create group shots.

Key insight: treating each key as a single token enables perfect retrieval at unlimited context lengths.
