The most notable regression vs the base model here is in arithmetic - if your workload is math heavy this model demonstrates an unfortunate collapse with performance under growing complexity. The interesting combination of awesome overall performance on SVG simple shapes identification coupled with a total inability to recognize more complex shapes like 'House' or 'Arrow' is a behavior directly inherited from the base model (but with a ~20% improvement in token utilization). If you like your reasoning models token-efficient, Aquif-3.5-8B-Think is well worth a spin.

A suite of 10 high-quality English legal IR datasets, designed by legal experts to set a new standard for comparing embedding models. Whether you\u2019re exploring legal RAG on your home computer, or running enterprise-scale retrieval, apples-to-apples evaluation is crucial. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve open-sourced everything - including our 7 brand-new, hand-crafted retrieval datasets. All of these datasets are now live on Hugging Face. Any guesses which embedding model leads on legal retrieval? \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d: it\u2019s not OpenAI or Google - they place 7th and 9th on our leaderboard. To do well on MLEB, embedding models must demonstrate both extensive legal domain knowledge and strong legal reasoning skills. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/abdurrahmanbutler/994710514786612", "date_published": "2025-10-17T17:19:27.197235"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431", "image": "", "title": "MLEB  is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models.", "content_text": "MLEB is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431", "date_published": "2025-10-17T17:19:27.197440"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/wenhuach/917073841450527", "image": "", "title": "AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! \ud83d\ude80", "content_text": "AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! \ud83d\ude80 After enhancing W2A16 quantization, we now offer a fast algorithm to generate mixed bits/data-type schemes (~2mins for 8B models), great for MXFP4 and W2A16.

A rather interesting attribute of these models is I have absolutely no idea what they are fine-tuned from, other then some kind of pre-small Mistrals! The non-nemo 15b looks like Mistral Pixtral 12B, but with 8 more layers while the nemo 15b analogously looks like Mistral NeMo 12B but with 10 more layers and a smaller max context length. The performance trade-offs between these two models are quite clear: the Nemotron provides ~30% shorter answers but at the expense of totally collapsing under difficulty on 4 of the 12 tasks ... which all just happen to have \"Math\" in common, so it's pretty easy to point the finger at exactly what the price for the lower reasoning token usage is here.
