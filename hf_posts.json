Built on the foundation of emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT, this model helps healthcare providers prioritize patient care by analyzing symptom descriptions and medical history. Why I Built This As healthcare systems face increasing demands, efficient triage becomes crucial. This model aims to support healthcare professionals in quickly assessing the urgency of medical situations, particularly in telehealth and high-volume settings. Model Performance The model was trained on 42,513 medical symptom descriptions, using an 80:20 train/test split.
