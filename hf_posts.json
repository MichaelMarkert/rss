For me, that was the key factor that accelerated scientific progress and made the impossible possible\u2014just look at the \u201cT\u201d in ChatGPT, which comes from the Transformer architecture openly shared by Google. Then came the myth that AI was too dangerous to share, and companies started optimizing for short-term revenue. That led many major AI labs and researchers to stop sharing and collaborating. With OAI and sama now saying they're willing to share open weights again, we have a real chance to return to a golden age of AI progress and democratization\u2014powered by openness and collaboration, in the US and around the world. This is incredibly exciting. Let\u2019s go, open science and open-source AI!

Full release notes: https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/releases/tag/v0.30.0 . \ud83d\ude80 Ready. Xet. Go! Xet is a groundbreaking new protocol for storing large objects in Git repositories, designed to replace Git LFS. Unlike LFS, which deduplicates files, Xet operates at the chunk level\u2014making it a game-changer for AI builders collaborating on massive models and datasets. Our Python integration is powered by [xet-core]( https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core ), a Rust-based package that handles all the low-level details. You can start using Xet today by installing the optional dependency: pip install -U huggingface_hub[hf_xet] With that, you can seamlessly download files from Xet-enabled repositories! And don\u2019t worry\u2014everything remains fully backward-compatible if you\u2019re not ready to upgrade yet.

It allows sourcing results from top search engines (including google, bing) for free. It uses searxng instances for this purpose. I was overwhelmed by community's response and I am glad for all the support and suggestions. So today, I have pushed several improvements that make this API more stable. These improvements include 1) Parallel scrapping of search results for faster response 2) Markdown formatting of search results 3) Prioritizing SearXNG instances that have faster google response time 4) Update/Get endpoints for searxng instances.
