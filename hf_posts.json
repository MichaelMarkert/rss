It costs me nothing, and I think it might be good to share it so that others can build on it. In README.md, you will find everything you need to get started and put your own microservice into production, which you can call from the app\u2019s HTTP request features. You will simply be asked to have a free Cloudflare account and an API key obtained from Google's AI Studio. Feel free to take a look and get back to me if you encounter any problems during deployment.

I'm excited to introduce a new Space I've been developing called LLM Forest Orchestra. This project converts the hidden states and attention patterns of transformer models into layered MIDI compositions. The concept draws inspiration from mushrooms and mycelial networks in forests. Fungi create underground connections linking plants and trees, establishing what some call a \"wood-wide web\" where signals and nutrients travel. Researchers have discovered that these exchanges form patterns resembling rhythms and pulses. When translated appropriately, these patterns can become music. Transformers operate through remarkably similar principles: tokens share signals via hidden states and attention heads. This Space transforms those invisible information flows into notes, chords, and rhythms, treating the model as a digital forest orchestra. \ud83c\udf9b Features * Two compute modes: - Full model operates on a Hugging Face model...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/640139873710354", "date_published": "2025-09-03T05:20:22.461249"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/Xenova/448209562329557", "image": "", "title": "Okay this is insane...

Simply put; training something with features gives a fair representative of the learning that you would get from running a model that has some random chance - using a single seed. Training with features does not need to wait for the representative model to actually generate; since you already generated everything ahead of time. Features are rich and utilizable within the spectrum of similarity assessments, classification accuracy, mass-deterministic normalization checks, and more. They are... put simply... exponentially faster and reusable for research. I'll include the notebooks used for imagenet and cifar100; as the cifar100 is much simpler since the cifar100 is much... smaller, I required less innovation. Imagenet is another beast though. This imagenet notebook is capable of running against much larger datasets with a few tweaks. clip-vit-bigG's imagenet feature set is complete, which means we're almost ready for full ablation.
