Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded >270...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495", "date_published": "2025-10-23T09:26:32.187510"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/paulml/601253280118572", "image": "", "title": "Qwen3-VL-4B is incredibly easy to fine-tune!", "content_text": "Qwen3-VL-4B is incredibly easy to fine-tune!

It's a black box, making replicating SOTA work impossible. We wanted to change that. FineVision unifies 200 sources into 24 million samples. With 17.3 million images and 9.5 billion answer tokens, it's the largest open resource of its kind. In the paper, we share how we built it: \ud83d\udd0d finding and cleaning data at scale \ud83e\uddf9 removing excessive duplicates across sources \ud83e\udd17 decontaminating against 66 public benchmarks My favorite part is Figure 6 (in the video!). It's our visual diversity analysis. It shows that FineVision isn't just bigger; it's more balanced and conceptually richer than other open datasets. NVIDIA's Eagle 2 paper highlighted just how critical this visual diversity is, and our results confirm it: models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/792285802244623", "date_published": "2025-10-23T09:26:32.188954"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/piercus/315056772255613", "image": "", "title": "\ud83d\udea7 Reproducing LBM-Eraser\u2026 in progress!

In LBM, they take a clever route \u2014 zeroing [3] and reshaping [4] the text-related cross-attentions into self-attentions.
