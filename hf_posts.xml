Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -&gt; InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -&gt; CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -&gt; ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:30:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893</guid></item><item><title>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/406218973183679</link><description>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀 🌟 Introduction Hello, AI research community! 🎉 Introducing Papers Impact - the revolutionary AI tool that automatically grades and predicts the potential impact of research papers! 🧠💡 VIDraft/PapersImpact ✨ Key Feature: Instant Paper Grading The core functionality is brilliantly simple: Just enter an arXiv paper ID or URL, and our AI instantly analyzes and grades the paper's potential academic impact!

It has 130 different tasks grouped into 8 categories, like image search, classification, clustering similar images, answering questions based on images, and understanding documents. It even covers 38 different languages. The authors tested 50 models and found that no single model was best at everything. Some models were great at recognizing text inside images but struggled to handle complicated tasks like matching images and text that appear together.
