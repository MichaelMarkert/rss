This video shows how you can use the script to invoke the large language model. And then you get a description of a movie in a second or three.

We just published a dataset using a new (for us) preference modality: direct ranking based on aesthetic preference. We ranked a couple of thousand images from most to least preferred, all sampled from the Open Image Preferences v1 dataset by the amazing @ data-is-better-together team. üìä Check it out here: Rapidata/2k-ranked-images-open-image-preferences-v1 We're really curious to hear your thoughts! Is this kind of ranking interesting or useful to you? Let us know! üí¨ If it is, please consider leaving a ‚ù§Ô∏è and if we hit 30 ‚ù§Ô∏ès, we‚Äôll go ahead and rank the full 17k image dataset!

I did a search, but all of the models and spaces I was able to find here didn't work, which I find surprising, since it's a great tool I already use. Perhaps one of you can provide a better option, or just tell me what this actually is to get it: https://dev.gptcall.pages.dev/chat#id=&amp;contactName=Youtube+summarizer Other functionality I'd like to see is a genre-based music creation and alteration model. "Make it country" or "do a freestyle rap," as examples. I'm willing to work with someone on this, because I'd need help understanding. I'd also like to make medical AI, like Dr. Samantha, that functions like a PDR well, and doesn't get confused by drug names.
