The most useful AI applications are moving toward multi-turn agentic behavior: systems that take hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to complete a task, e.g. Claude Code, computer-control agents that click, type, and test repeatedly. In these cases, the power of the model is not how smart it is per token, but in how quickly it can interact with its environment and tools across many steps. In that regime, model quality becomes secondary to latency. An open-source model that can call tools quickly, check that the right thing was clicked, or verify that a code change actually passes tests can easily outperform a slightly “smarter” closed model that has to make remote API calls for every move. Eventually, the balance tips: it becomes impractical for an agent to rely on remote inference for every micro-action. Just as no one would tolerate a keyboard that required a network request per keystroke, users won’t accept...</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:23:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/941146046599374</guid></item><item><title>fine-tuning a 14B model with TRL + SFT on a free Colab (T4 GPU)?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/990279445625588</link><description>fine-tuning a 14B model with TRL + SFT on a free Colab (T4 GPU)? thanks to the latest TRL optimizations, you actually can! sharing a new notebook showing how to do it 😎 colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/sft_trl_lora_qlora.ipynb notebooks in TRL: https://github.com/huggingface/trl/tree/main/examples/notebooks See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:23:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/990279445625588</guid></item><item><title>Experience the future of fashion with our AI-powered virtual try-on technology.

It got silent around my open source activities the last year, so i thought something has to change. That's why my focus will move to share experiences and insights about hardware, drivers, kernels and linux. I won't post about how to use models, built agents or do prompting. I want to share about some deeper layers the actual hypes are built on. I will start posting summarizations of my articles here on the hub.

In recent weeks, numerous new PO methods have emerged that build on or replace the popular PPO and GRPO, solving their issues. Here are 11 of them: 1. BAlanced Policy Optimization (BAPO) → BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (2510.18927) Dynamically adjusting the clipping bounds in PPO-style updates to balance positive and negative gradients and prevent entropy collapse 2. Training-Free GRPO → Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (2510.08191) Instead of using numeric rewards, it compares rollouts semantically to distill useful knowledge as a token prior, which is then applied during inference to guide the model’s behavior 3. Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO) → ASPO: Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization...</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:23:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/468043722468280</guid></item><item><title>On this day in 2019, OpenAI released the final GPT-2 model as part of their staged release.

I still remember that November well - so much was happening, but GPT-2's release felt like a watershed moment for the field. It showed us what was possible with carefully trained language models. To recreate some of that GPT-2 magic, I recently tackled an interesting challenge: can you pretrain a language model with just 1 billion tokens - roughly 1/10th of what GPT-2 used - and still get comparable performance? After 50+ systematic experiments testing different dataset mixtures, the answer is yes. The result is **codelion/gpt-2-70m** ( codelion/gpt-2-70m ), which achieves over 90% of GPT-2's benchmark performance despite being trained on 10x less data. The key was finding the optimal dataset composition: 50% high-quality textbook PDFs, 30% filtered web content, and 20% educational resources. It even beats GPT-2 on TruthfulQA (47.31% vs 40.69%).

And yes, those matter immensely. But here's what nobody tells you: when your training run fails at 2 AM because of mysterious 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫𝐬, or when your expensive GPU cluster is running at 𝟔𝟎% 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, the problem isn't your model. It's most probably a 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞. 🛠️ Questions that seemed simple but had no clear answers: Why is 𝐌𝐨𝐄 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬? Which 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐬 should we actually set? How often should we checkpoint without killing throughput? That's why we built 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 📖: a complete guide covering everything from model architecture and data curation to the SmolLM3 training marathon, post-training techniques, and crucially, the 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 that most teams get wrong.
