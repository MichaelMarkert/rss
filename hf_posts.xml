But what happens when an AI tells you "I understand how you feel" and you actually believe it? At Hugging Face, together with @ frimelle and @ yjernite , we dug into something we felt wasn't getting enough attention: the need to evaluate AI companionship behaviors. These are the subtle ways AI systems validate us, engage with us, and sometimes manipulate our emotional lives. Here's what we found: 👉 Existing benchmarks (accuracy, helpfulness, safety) completely miss this emotional dimension. 👉 We mapped how leading AI systems actually respond to vulnerable prompts. 👉 We built the Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA): a first attempt at evaluating how models handle emotional dependency, boundaries, and attachment (with a full paper coming soon).

As we close this chapter, we're laying the groundwork for a more modular and community-driven future: - Optimum v2: A lightweight core package for porting Transformers, Diffusers, or Sentence-Transformers to specialized AI hardware/software/accelerators.. - Optimum‑ONNX: A dedicated package where the ONNX/ONNX Runtime ecosystem lives and evolves, faster-moving and decoupled from the Optimum core. 🎯 Why this matters: - A clearer governance path for ONNX, fostering stronger community collaboration and improved developer experience.. - Enable innovation at a faster pace in a more modular, open-source environment. 💡 What this means: - More transparency, broader participation, and faster development driven by the community and key actors in the ONNX ecosystem (PyTorch, Microsoft, Joshua Lochner 👀, ...) - A cleaner, more maintainable core Optimum, focused on extending HF libraries to special AI...</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:24:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/721004690541036</guid></item></channel></rss>
