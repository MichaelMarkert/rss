It was one of the first cases where the future of generative media really hit us. Humans are incredibly good at recognizing and analyzing faces, so they are a very good litmus test for any generative image model. But none of the current benchmarks measure the ability of models to generate humans independently. So we built our own. We measure the models ability to generate a diverse set of human faces and using over 20'000 human annotations we ranked all of the major models on their ability to generate faces. Find the full ranking here: https://app.rapidata.ai/mri/benchmarks/68af24ae74482280b62f7596 We have release the full underlying data publicly here on huggingface: Rapidata/Face_Generation_Benchmark See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:33:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/614528339803376</guid></item><item><title>7+ Main precision formats used in AI:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/707388483660581</link><description>7+ Main precision formats used in AI: Precision is very important in AI as it shapes how accurate and efficient models are. It controls how finely numbers are represented, approximating real-world values with formats like fixed-point and floating-point. A recent BF16 → FP16 study renewed attention to precision impact. Here are the main precision types used in AI, from full precision for training to ultra-low precision for inference: 1. FP32 (Float32): Standard full-precision float used in most training: 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 mantissa bits. Default for backward-compatible training and baseline numerical stability 2. FP16 (Float16) → https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10947v6 Half-precision float. It balances accuracy and efficiency. 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 mantissa bits. Common on NVIDIA Tensor Cores and mixed-precision setups. There’s now a new wave of using it in reinforcement learning: https://www.turingpost.com/p/fp16 3.

You negotiate with it. The hardware absolutely delivers. Spoiler alert; there is exactly ONE configuration where vLLM + ROCm + Triton + PyTorch + Drivers + Ubuntu Kernel to work at the same time. Finding it required the patience of a saint Consumer AMD for AI inference is the ultimate "budget warrior" play, insane performance-per-euro, but you need hardcore technical skills that would make a senior sysadmin nod in quiet respect.

We've got you covered. We're releasing a collection of several carefully curated 1B token dataset samples specifically designed for rapid prototyping and pretraining experiments: https://huggingface.co/collections/codelion/pre-training-dataset-samples These samples were created using reservoir sampling - an algorithm that guarantees statistically unbiased random samples from massive source datasets. This means results you get at the 1B token scale are representative of how these datasets behave at 100B+ token scales, letting you iterate quickly without the computational overhead. The collection includes: - finePDFs-1B: High-quality textbook-style educational content - DCLM-baseline-1B: Filtered, diverse web content - FineWeb-Edu-1B: Curated educational web resources We used these exact samples to run 50+ systematic experiments on dataset mixing strategies, ultimately discovering that a...</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:33:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/147786491495276</guid></item><item><title>You can now run Kimi K2 Thinking locally with our Dynamic 1-bit GGUFs:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/603265034116639</link><description>You can now run Kimi K2 Thinking locally with our Dynamic 1-bit GGUFs: unsloth/Kimi-K2-Thinking-GGUF We shrank the 1T model to 245GB (-62%) &amp; retained ~85% of accuracy on Aider Polyglot.

The version will be open source and agreed upon with @ therobotbuilder the creator of the original manipulator. We are planning to: - increase positioning accuracy by approximately 2x using Feetech STS 3250 motors - increase working payload from 200g to 300g - increase rigidity using parametric design optimization and stiffer plastic - increase length to 550 mm - increase folding angles - use ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 mounting standard for the gripper - use a parallel gripper in the default version - update the mounting plate for different camera types, M3 grid with 12.5 mm pitch - add table mounting standard 80x80 M8 The number of degrees of freedom and basic kinematics will remain the same. Are there other things missing for working with SO ARM 100? - Any standard inputs/outputs, for example? - Status indicators? - Perhaps some types of mounting for third-party grippers are more preferable? -...</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:33:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/750415743005221</guid></item><item><title>Qwen Image Base Model Training vs FLUX SRPO Training 20 images comparison (top ones Qwen bottom ones FLUX) - Same Dataset (28 imgs) - I can't return back to FLUX such as massive difference - Qwen destroys the FLUX at complex prompts and emotions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/857881021159484</link><description>Qwen Image Base Model Training vs FLUX SRPO Training 20 images comparison (top ones Qwen bottom ones FLUX) - Same Dataset (28 imgs) - I can't return back to FLUX such as massive difference - Qwen destroys the FLUX at complex prompts and emotions Full tutorial link &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPX3eBTuO_Y Info This is a full comprehensive step-by-step tutorial for how to train Qwen Image models.
