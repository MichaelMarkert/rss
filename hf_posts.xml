Maybe someone will find it useful? It's also because I want to get into the habit of writing, but had no motivation to do so. Maybe writing short informal posts will help build the habit. Since I don't have a personal site, and don't plan to create one in the near future, I think HF posts are best suited for short and informal documentation to share my little discoveries and learnings. If you're interested, strap in! First post in this series will be on basic study of Pytorch's float32 matmuls and their Triton implementation (nothing much, just the tutorial...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:18:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283</guid></item><item><title>this repo is gold! a collection of LLM apps with multi-agents, MCP, RAG and so much more.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/842061188959684</link><description>this repo is gold! a collection of LLM apps with multi-agents, MCP, RAG and so much more. the best way to learn is by building, and this repo provides the blueprint.

First and foremost, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude for Hugging Face's continuous support and efforts. 💙 Our Openfree AI collaborates with various AI communities across Korea, contributing to knowledge sharing and ecosystem development. 🤝 I've been actively promoting the critical importance of Hugging Face as Korea's AI infrastructure backbone, engaging with senior government officials, National Assembly members, university leaders, and media executives to emphasize how Hugging Face represents Korea's AI future at a national policy level. I consider myself a 'voluntary Korean ambassador for Hugging Face'. 🇰🇷✨ Let me share our community's achievements on the Hugging Face platform over the past year: 🎯 🚀 Published hundreds of models and spaces 👥 Surpassed 10 million cumulative visitors 📈 Achieved 1.7 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) 🎨 Generated over 1 million images/videos per month These...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:18:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/428786122279500</guid></item><item><title>Can AI models trained solely on 100% synthetic data achieve top-tier accuracy in real-world object detection?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/399941870774449</link><description>Can AI models trained solely on 100% synthetic data achieve top-tier accuracy in real-world object detection? 👉 Sergio Sanz, PhD just proved it while winning Duality AI’s Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Challenge using Falcon-generated imagery. His model achieved perfect real-world detection accuracy without a single real image in the training loop. In this blog, Dr. Sanz walks us through his method, which includes the design and training of an advanced pipeline to achieve 100% detection accuracy. His full technical breakdown covers: 📍 Synthetic-only training 📍 Data augmentation with an ensemble learning approach for better generalization 📍 Custom occlusion generation 📍 A Faster R-CNN model fine-tuned with Falcon generated data 📍 And much more! The results speak for themselves! 📖 Read the blog here: https://www.duality.ai/blog/leveraging-synthetic-data-for-real-world-object-detection Congratulations Sergio!

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/ε²) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, ε = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/ε) examples (where d = input...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:18:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125</guid></item><item><title>New diffusion model for text-to-image and video-to-world generation: Cosmos Predict-2 👽</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/709852031491261</link><description>New diffusion model for text-to-image and video-to-world generation: Cosmos Predict-2 👽 Model collection: nvidia/cosmos-predict2-68028efc052239369a0f2959 Diffusers support: https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11695 Documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/cosmos These are results with the 2B param model.
