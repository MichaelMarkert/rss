Real security is about layers.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</link><description>A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers. The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, "Whispered Tuning", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. 🔗 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:04:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</guid></item><item><title>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/790273915312125</link><description>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena. 🏆 The Champions: Claude-Opus-4.5, Gemini-3-Pro, GPT-5.2, and Gemini-3-Flash sweep the top four spots. 🚀 The Pursuers: Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.2 tie for first place among Chinese models; GLM-4.7, ERNIE-5.0, and Kimi secure their positions in the domestic top five. 🔥 The Biggest Highlight: The top three spots on the open-source leaderboard are entirely held by Team China (DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), outperforming the best western open-source models.

At just 0.9 billion parameters, it belongs to a new generation of lightweight AI systems proving that raw model size is no longer the only path to high performance. Despite its small footprint, GLM-OCR posts exceptionally strong results across major document benchmarks. It scores 94.6 on OmniDocBench, 94.0 on OCRBench, and an impressive 96.5 on UniMERNet for formula recognition—numbers that place it alongside, and in some cases ahead of, significantly larger specialized OCR models. The takeaway is clear: efficiency is rapidly becoming a defining feature of modern AI design. Developed by Z.ai, a research group focused on advancing multimodal foundation models, GLM-OCR reflects a broader shift toward highly optimized architectures that deliver serious capability without requiring massive compute...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:04:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Javedalam/705319100384927</guid></item><item><title>🤔 Do you have a Hugging Face Space that you wish you could programmatically restart to induce data refresh or some other behavior?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/621232711062929</link><description>🤔 Do you have a Hugging Face Space that you wish you could programmatically restart to induce data refresh or some other behavior? 👉 Try Spaces Scheduler for this use case: https://github.com/kghamilton89/spaces-scheduler ➡️ Lightweight ➡️ Easy to setup ➡️ Just works 😎 Happy to share some tooling with the Hugging Face community that's given me so much.
