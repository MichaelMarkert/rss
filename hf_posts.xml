A few weeks ago, @ mmuffo94 and @ cittiberto from indigo_ai launched the Chatbot Arena for the Italian language: https://indigo.ai/it/chatbot-arena-italia/ . To our surprise, among the top-ranked models is mii-llm/maestrale-chat-v0.4-beta a carefully fine-tuned version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 , developed by @ efederici and @ mferraretto from https://huggingface.co/mii-llm , and released nearly a year ago. At this very moment, as shown in the screenshot, mii-llm/maestrale-chat-v0.4-beta is ranked 8th right between ChatGPT-4.5 and ChatGPT-4o. It's likely that for several months, the best Italian speaking LLM has been an open source 7B model created by open source contributors and hardly anyone knew it.

In my latest blog post, I explore why these traditional consent models are increasingly problematic in the age of generative AI. I found three fundamental challenges: - Scope problem: how can you know what you're agreeing to when AI could use your data in different ways? - Temporality problem: once an AI system learns from your data, good luck trying to make it "unlearn" it. - Autonomy trap: the data you share today could create systems that pigeonhole you tomorrow. Individual users shouldn't bear all the responsibility, while big tech holds all the cards. We need better approaches to level the playing field, from collective advocacy and stronger technological safeguards to establishing "data fiduciaries" with a legal duty to protect our digital interests.

We've just completed the first-ever (to our knowledge) benchmarking of the new OpenAI 4o image generation model, and the results are impressive! In our tests, OpenAI 4o image generation absolutely crushed leading competitors, including @ black-forest-labs , @ google , @ xai-org , Ideogram, Recraft, and @ deepseek-ai , in prompt alignment and coherence! They hold a gap of more than 20% to the nearest competitor in terms of Bradley-Terry score, the biggest we have seen since the beginning of the benchmark! The benchmarks are based on 200k human responses collected through our API. However, the most challenging part wasn't the benchmarking itself, but generating and downloading the images: - 5 hours to generate 1000 images (no API available yet) - Just 10 minutes to set up and launch the benchmark - Over 200,000 responses rapidly collected While generating the images, we faced some hurdles that meant that we had to leave out...</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:19:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/659246791111385</guid></item><item><title>Besides being the coolest named benchmark in the game, HellaSwag is an important measurement of –∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤—ã–π —Å–º—ã—Å–ª—å (or common sense) in LLMs.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/895817584228018</link><description>Besides being the coolest named benchmark in the game, HellaSwag is an important measurement of –∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤—ã–π —Å–º—ã—Å–ª—å (or common sense) in LLMs. - More on HellaSwag: https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag I spent the afternoon benchmarking YandexGPT Pro 4th Gen, one of the Russian tech giant's premier models. - Yandex HF Org: https://huggingface.co/yandex - More on Yandex models: https://yandex.cloud/ru/docs/foundation-models/concepts/yandexgpt/models The eval notebook is available on GitHub and the resulting dataset is already on the HF Hub! - Eval Notebook: https://github.com/kghamilton89/ai-explorer/blob/main/yandex-hellaswag/hellaswag-assess.ipynb - Eval Dataset: ZennyKenny/yandexgptpro_4th_gen-hellaswag And of course, everyone wants to see the results so have a look at the results in the context of other zero-shot experiments that I was able to find!
