With advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL), machines are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of making decisions autonomously. This shift is having a significant impact on society as we know it. One of the most notable aspects of RL is its ability to learn from experience. By observing and interacting with its surroundings, an AI-driven RL system can adapt to new situations and make decisions based on real-world data. This has huge implications for industries like healthcare, where AI can be used to analyze patient data and provide personalized treatment plans, or finance, where it can help predict market trends and make more informed investment decisions. Furthermore, RL is driving innovation in robotics and automation. Autonomous vehicles, for example, rely on RL to navigate complex environments safely...</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 05:24:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ghostai1/378992241286931</guid></item><item><title>IN: video fine-tuning support for</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/227325205054335</link><description>IN: video fine-tuning support for facebook V-JEPA 2 in HF transformers üî• it comes with &gt; four models fine-tuned on Diving48 and SSv2 dataset facebook/v-jepa-2-6841bad8413014e185b497a6 &gt; FastRTC demo on V-JEPA2 SSv2 qubvel-hf/vjepa2-streaming-video-classification &gt; fine-tuning script on UCF-101 https://gist.github.com/ariG23498/28bccc737c11d1692f6d0ad2a0d7cddb &gt; fine-tuning notebook on UCF-101 https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16NWUReXTJBRhsN3umqznX4yoZt2I7VGc?usp=sharing we're looking forward to see what you will build! ü§ó See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 05:24:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/227325205054335</guid></item><item><title>Self-Forcing - a real-time video distilled model from Wan 2.1 by</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/multimodalart/420236527922092</link><description>Self-Forcing - a real-time video distilled model from Wan 2.1 by @ adobe is out, and they open sourced it üêê I've built a live real time demo on Spaces üìπüí® multimodalart/self-forcing See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 05:24:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/multimodalart/420236527922092</guid></item><item><title>not sure of what to make of this but solving autonomous/selective reflection seems like a big deal in current agent frameworks.
