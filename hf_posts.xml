Our v2.0 quants set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU and KL Divergence, meaning you can now run &amp; fine-tune quantized LLMs while preserving as much accuracy as possible. Llama 4: unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct-GGUF DeepSeek-R1: unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-UD Gemma 3: unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF We made selective layer quantization much smarter. Instead of modifying only a subset of layers, we now dynamically quantize all layers so every layer has a different bit. Now, our dynamic method can be applied to all LLM architectures, not just MoE's. Blog with Details: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/dynamic-v2.0 All our future GGUF uploads will leverage Dynamic 2.0 and our hand curated 300K–1.5M token calibration dataset to improve conversational chat performance. For accurate benchmarking, we built an evaluation framework to match the reported 5-shot MMLU scores of Llama 4 and Gemma 3. This allowed apples-to-apples comparisons between full-...</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 09:21:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/766411311755038</guid></item><item><title>🚀 AI Blog Generator with Streamlit: The Ultimate Guide!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/721764114758575</link><description>🚀 AI Blog Generator with Streamlit: The Ultimate Guide! ginigen/blogger Hello there!

I've been diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol) to understand what the hype was all about. It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that can be hooked to LLMs. But while doing that, came my second realization: Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. 🤯 ➡️ read it exclusively on the official HF blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 09:21:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176</guid></item><item><title>🙋🏽‍♂️ Is your "multi agent" system really multi agentic?

Or is it just a modular setup with a bunch of different prompts? 🤨 I’ve had this discussion way too often, so I finally wrote it all down. If you’re building with agents, you need to read this. Here’s the TLDR: ✅ True multi agent systems require: • Persistent, private state per agent • Memory that impacts future decisions • Adaptation based on past experiences ❌ Just having modular components, function calls, or multiple LLMs doesn't cut it. That’s not multi agentic. It’s just pipelining. 🤝 The magic is in evolving relationships, context retention, and behavioral shifts over time. 🧠 If your agents aren’t learning from each other or changing based on past experience… you are missing the point.

An Android AI agent powered by open-source ML model, 𝗱𝗲𝗸𝗶, was fully open-sourced. It understands what’s on your screen and can perform tasks based on your voice or text commands. Some examples: * "Write my friend "some_name" in WhatsApp that I'll be 15 minutes late" * "Open Twitter in the browser and write a post about something" * "Read my latest notifications" * "Write a linkedin post about something" Currently, it works only on Android — but support for other OS is planned. The ML and backend codes were also fully open-sourced. Video prompt example: "Open linkedin, tap post and write: hi, it is deki, and now I am open sourced. But don't send, just return" License: GPLv3 You can find other AI agent demos or usage examples, like, code generation or object detection in github.

The panelists are managers/directors of Fortune 500 companies. These people make things happen and own results, so their stories and pain points are fresh. (1) Models are used EVERYWHERE, customer facing and internal support, etc. (2) A successful application must improve one of the following: revenue (💵💵), cost (💵💵), CSAT (still 💵💵) (3) They proactively search on 🤗HF🤗 for models and use them. Open source models (especially small ones) can flexibly fit into their existing workflows/infras, which enable them to deliver, and fast. (4) The main barrier for adoption is license. A director told me they picked a model and finetuned it, then learned they would have to share enhancements. As a result, they dropped this model and the million dollar impact went to another model. So to fellow model builders: (1) celebrate that our work is useful and generate lots of values (2) make your license permissive if you want maximum impact See...</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 09:21:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/992154552707771</guid></item><item><title>Think AGI is just around the corner? Not so fast.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/shekkizh/738330695730383</link><description>Think AGI is just around the corner? Not so fast. When OpenAI released its Computer-Using Agent (CUA) API, I happened to be playing Wordle 🧩 and thought, why not see how the model handles it? Spoiler: Wordle turned out to be a surprisingly effective benchmark. So Romain Cosentino Ph.D. and I dug in and analyzed the results of several hundred runs. 🔑 Takeaways 1️⃣ Even the best computer-using models struggle with simple, context-dependent tasks. 2️⃣ Visual perception and reasoning remain major hurdles for multimodal agents. 3️⃣ Real-world use cases reveal significant gaps between hype and reality.
