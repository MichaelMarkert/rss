Today, Gradio is used by &gt;1 million developers each month to build and share AI web apps. This includes some of the most popular open-source projects of all time, like Automatic1111, Fooocus, Oobabooga’s Text WebUI, Dall-E Mini, and LLaMA-Factory. How did we get here? How did Gradio keep growing in the very crowded field of open-source Python libraries? I get this question a lot from folks who are building their own open-source libraries. This post distills some of the lessons that I have learned over the past few years: 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level abstractions 2. Embed virality directly into your library 3. Focus on a (growing) niche 4. Your only roadmap should be rapid iteration 5. Maximize ways users can consume your library's outputs 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level...</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 13:25:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/192598522318521</guid></item><item><title>Llama models (arguably the most successful open AI models of all times) just represented 3% of total model downloads on Hugging Face in March.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/clem/620280881336518</link><description>Llama models (arguably the most successful open AI models of all times) just represented 3% of total model downloads on Hugging Face in March. People and media like stories of winner takes all &amp; one model/company to rule them all but the reality is much more nuanced than this! Kudos to all the small AI builders out there!

Is there any possibility I could collaborate or assist with any of your research works ? I’m happy to support ongoing projects, contribute to data analysis, code, documentation, or anything that adds value. Thank you for your time and consideration!

This marks the beginning of our journey to become the standard for testing text-to-image and generative models. Our expertise in large-scale human annotations allows researchers to refine their models with accurate, real-world feedback. As we continue to establish ourselves as a key player in model evaluation, we’re here to support researchers with high-quality annotations at scale.
