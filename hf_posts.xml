I wanted to share: 1. ‚ö° Tokens/sec performance across several SLLMs 2. ü§ñ Observations on hardware utilization (where the workload actually runs) 3. üìè Trade-offs between model size, latency, and feasibility for mobile apps There are reports for below models - QWEN3 0.6B - NVIDIA/Nemotron QWEN 1.5B - SimpleScaling S1 - TinyLlama - Unsloth tuned Llama 3.2 1B - Naver HyperClova 0.5B üìúComparable Benchmark reports (no cloud, all on-device): I‚Äôd really value your thoughts on: - Creative ideas to further optimize inference under these hardware constraints - Other compact LLMs worth testing on-device - Experiences you‚Äôve had trying to deploy LLMs at the edge If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôm happy to share more details on the test setup, hardware specs, or the tooling we used for these comparisons. Thanks for taking a look, and you can build your own...</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:26:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</link><description>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model Dhanishtha 2.0 is the world's first LLM designed to think between the responses. Unlike other Reasoning LLMs, which think just once. Dhanishtha can think, rethink, self-evaluate, and refine in between responses using multiple &lt;think&gt; blocks. This technique makes it Hinghlt Token efficient it Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 --- You can try our model from: https://helpingai.co/chat Also, we're gonna Open-Source Dhanistha on July 1st. --- For Devs: üîë Get your API key at https://helpingai.co/dashboard from HelpingAI import HAI # pip install HelpingAI ==1.1.1 from rich import print hai = HAI( api_key = "hl-***********************" ) response = hai.chat.completions.create( model = "Dhanishtha-2.0-preview" , messages=[{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "What is the value of ‚à´0‚àûùë•3/ùë•‚àí1ùëëùë• ?" }], stream = True , hide_think = False # Hide or show models thinking ) for chunk in response: print...</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:26:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</guid></item><item><title>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/610118153924016</link><description>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th! Hugging Face just wrapped 4 months of deep work with AMD to push kernel-level optimization on their MI300X GPUs. Now, it's time to share everything we learned. Join us in Paris at STATION F for a hands-on weekend of workshops and a hackathon focused on making open-source LLMs faster and more efficient on AMD.

Hoping it'll work for ALL tools if lmstudio gets an update or something, not just llama.cpp, but very happy to see it works flawlessly in llama.cpp...</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:26:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/460622149989234</guid></item><item><title>Working on some chess set concepts.
