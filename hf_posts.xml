Typically, quantizing the LLM to INT4 (unlike say INT8) for inference can incur some accuracy loss. Instead of accepting the quality loss, we used the FP16 model as a teacher to train a tiny LoRA adapter (rank=16) for the quantized model. The cool part: the model generates its own training data using the Magpie technique so no external datasets needed. This is critical because we want to remain as much as possible in the distribution of the model's natural responses. Last year Apple's foundational models paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075 ) had proposed a similar technique and found "By using accuracy-recovery LoRA adapters with only rank 16, Alpaca win rate can be improved by 7-18%, GMS8K accuracy is boosted by 5-10%." (page 47). We saw similar results on Qwen3-0.6B: Perplexity: 2.40 → 2.09 (only 5.7% degradation from FP16 baseline) Memory: Only 0.28GB vs 1.0GB...</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:30:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/741062673202173</guid></item><item><title>MiniCPM-V 4.5 🚀 New MLLM for image, multi-image &amp; video understanding, running even on your phone, released by OpenBMB</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/473496396970919</link><description>MiniCPM-V 4.5 🚀 New MLLM for image, multi-image &amp; video understanding, running even on your phone, released by OpenBMB openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5 ✨ SOTA vision language capability ✨ 96× video token compression &gt; high-FPS &amp; long video reasoning ✨ Switchable fast vs deep thinking modes ✨ Strong OCR, document parsing, supports 30+ languages See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:30:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/473496396970919</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/809439997973106</link><description>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On! 🚀 Now Live and Free to Use!Say goodbye to online shopping uncertainty - "Will this look good on me?" - with our revolutionary solution!Fashion Fit 360 is a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual fitting service that transforms your fashion shopping experience.

Best clicks + best plans. The problem: every GUI model speaks a different dialect. • some want pixel coordinates • others want percentages • a few spit out cursed tokens like &lt;|loc095|&gt; We built a universal interface that works the same across Anthropic, OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.: agent = ComputerAgent( model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", tools=[computer] ) But here’s the fun part: you can combine models by specialization. Grounding model (sees + clicks) + Planning model (reasons + decides) → agent = ComputerAgent( model="huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+openai/gpt-4o", tools=[computer] ) This gives GUI skills to models that were never built for computer use.

Model now shows step-by-step thinking in &lt;think&gt; tags before answering. Logic puzzle accuracy: 61% → 84%. 3 hours training on single GPU. 🧠 Used GRPO where model generates multiple responses and learns to prefer better reasoning. Works surprisingly well for making smaller models more transparent. 🔗 Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/codelion/ellora/blob/main/Ellora_Recipe_2_Reasoning_LoRA_with_Self-Rewarding_GRPO.ipynb 🤗 Model: codelion/gemma-3-1b-it-reasoning-grpo-lora 💻 Code: https://github.com/codelion/ellora See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:30:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/968650774475150</guid></item><item><title>I'm currently looking into what makes a scientific paper more popular than others on a platform like Hugging Face.

I conducted a huge array of tests, content length, time based information even semantic feature extraction to get to some sort of answer around... What actually drives popularity of these papers, why do some papers get zero upvotes and why do some get thousands? The answer is absolutely nothing. Yes that's right. Nothing about the actual paper itself drives popularity, the paper's popularity is driven by external factors like it's authors, external marketing and others. So next time you see a research paper with a lot of upvotes, just remember it's not because of the efforts of the authors. Remain objective.
