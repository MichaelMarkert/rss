Here are my notes on it: &gt; MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) &gt; Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. &gt; They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 "first dense" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 13:41:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992</guid></item><item><title>üß¨ Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face üî¨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MaziyarPanahi/751516664507693</link><description>üß¨ Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face üî¨ OpenMed is back! üî• Finding the right biomedical NER model just became as precise as a PCR assay! I'm thrilled to unveil my comprehensive OpenMed Named Entity Recognition Model Discovery App that puts 384 specialized biomedical AI models at your fingertips. üéØ Why This Matters in Healthcare AI: Traditional clinical text mining required hours of manual model evaluation. My Discovery App instantly connects researchers, clinicians, and data scientists with the exact NER models they need for their biomedical entity extraction tasks. üî¨ What You Can Discover: ‚úÖ Pharmacological Models - Extract "chemical compounds", "drug interactions", and "pharmaceutical" entities from clinical notes ‚úÖ Genomics &amp; Proteomics - Identify "DNA sequences", "RNA transcripts", "gene variants", "protein complexes", and "cell lines" ‚úÖ Pathology &amp; Disease Detection - Recognize "pathological formations", "cancer types",...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 13:41:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MaziyarPanahi/751516664507693</guid></item><item><title>6 Essential Reads on core AI/ML topics:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/570379597864718</link><description>6 Essential Reads on core AI/ML topics: Time to look at some free useful resources that can help you upgrade your knowledge of AI and machine learning! Today we offer you these 6 must-read surveys that can be your perfect guides to the major fields and techniques: 1. Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu ‚Üí https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09223 Many recommend this 270-page book as a good resource to focus on fundamental concepts, such as pre-training, generative models, prompting, alignment, and inference 2. Large Language Models Post-Training: Surveying Techniques from Alignment to Reasoning -&gt; A Survey on Post-training of Large Language Models (2503.06072) Read this to master policy optimization (RLHF, DPO, GRPO), supervised and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, reasoning, integration, and adaptation techniques 3.
