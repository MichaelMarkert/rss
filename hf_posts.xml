For years, robotics has been locked behind high prices and complex systems. So we decided to change that. Today, we’re open-sourcing Ark-Bot — a fully 3D-printed, 6-DOF robot arm that works seamlessly with our Python robotics library, Ark. And yes… It’s only £215.86 to build. 🧠ArkBot Specs 🧠 1️⃣ Reach: 1 meter 2️⃣ Weight: 2.6 kg 3️⃣ Payload: 1.8 kg 💪 4️⃣ DOF: 6 5️⃣ Input Voltage: DC 12V 🤟Fully 3D-printable &amp; open-source 🤟Integrated with Ark — no ROS required 📹 We’ve also released a video showing the full assembly process — because robotics should be something everyone can learn, build, and improve on. 👩‍🎓 With Ark-Bot, anyone — from students to AI researchers — can experiment with embodied AI, robot learning, and control algorithms on real hardware, affordably. If you could control a 1-meter robot arm from your laptop for under £220… 👉 What would you build first? 🔗https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_bot 🎥...</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hba123/315319549896319</guid></item><item><title>Have built the new Image Studio with the Gemini Image Gen models for the following multiple tasks:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/886559259732378</link><description>Have built the new Image Studio with the Gemini Image Gen models for the following multiple tasks: imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001 model for Image Generation (Text-to-Image) and Multi-Image Editing (Image-to-Image), and Draw-to-Image powered by gemini-2.5-flash-image (aka Nano Banana). ⭐ Gemini-Image-Studio: prithivMLmods/Gemini-Image-Studio (Latest) 🤞 Old-App: prithivMLmods/Nano-Banana-AIO 🥊 GitHub: https://github.com/prithivsakthiur/gemini-image-studio-hf To proceed, you need to add your Gemini API key.

In short: it's a very tiny Transformers, but it loops over itself at two different frequencies, updating two latent variables: one for the proposed answer and one for the reasoning. @ AlexiaJM started from the paper Hierarchical Reasoning Model, published a few months ago, that already showed breakthrough improvement on AGI for its small size (27M) Hierarchical Reasoning Model had introduced one main feature: 🔎 Deep supervision In their model, one part (here one layer) would run at high frequency, and...</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/175050207181959</guid></item><item><title>Hi, I just published research paper that's introducing my Reactive Transformer (RxT) architecture.

I would be grateful if you could check it and upvote on HuggingFace Daily Papers - Reactive Transformer (RxT) -- Stateful Real-Time Processing for Event-Driven Reactive Language Models (2510.03561) Architecture is based on stateful real-time processing with innovational asynchronous memory update. Instead of reprocessing all the conversation history for each message, it's processing only single query with all the context moved to dedicated memory layers. Memory is updated after generating the answer, so it's not influencing latency - in tests, time to first token was almost the same as generating a single token. It has also better quality/accuracy in multi-turn dialogue than the same size stateless decoder-only model. Initial experiments were small scale (12M to 160M params models trained on simple synthetic datasets), but just now I'm starting training of bigger 270M params model on...</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdamF92/854077189361039</guid></item><item><title>I found it excellent and very well done.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/229668569857091</link><description>I found it excellent and very well done.

I’ve ported the BDH ( https://github.com/pathwaycom/bdh ) model to MLX for Apple Silicon. It’s a faithful conversion of the PyTorch version: same math, same architecture (byte-level vocab, shared weights across layers, ReLU sparsity, RoPE attention with Q=K), with MLX-friendly APIs and a detailed README explaining the few API-level differences and why results are equivalent. Code, docs, and training script are ready to use. You may need to adjust the training script a bit to fit your own custom dataset. Only tested on M4 so far, but should work perfect for any M1/M2/M3 users out there. I’m currently training this MLX build on my Internal Knowledge Map (IKM) dataset Severian/Internal-Knowledge-Map Training’s underway; expect a day or so before I publish weights. When it’s done, I’ll upload the checkpoint to Hugging Face for anyone to test.
