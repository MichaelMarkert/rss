Fully automated, now live on Spotify. I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don’t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you’re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It’s not perfect yet — I’ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it’s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community — submit a PR or send feedback. It’s just a beta of an experimental idea! Big kudos to @ m-ric , whose Open NotebookLM this is based on, and to @ nielsr for his...</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 09:25:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/617387724043904</guid></item><item><title>Samsung Hacking Incident: Samsung Electronics' Official Hugging Face Account Compromised</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</link><description>Samsung Hacking Incident: Samsung Electronics' Official Hugging Face Account Compromised Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account has been hacked. Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on "1 million W200 GPUs," hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack. Samsung Electronics appears to be unaware of this situation, as they have not taken any visible...</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 09:25:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</guid></item><item><title>Lumier – Run macOS &amp; Linux VMs in a Docker</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/465197265329383</link><description>Lumier – Run macOS &amp; Linux VMs in a Docker Lumier is an open-source tool for running macOS virtual machines in Docker containers on Apple Silicon Macs. When building virtualized environments for AI agents, we needed a reliable way to package and distribute macOS VMs. Inspired by projects like dockur/macos that made macOS running in Docker possible, we wanted to create something similar but optimized for Apple Silicon. The existing solutions either didn't support M-series chips or relied on KVM/Intel emulation, which was slow and cumbersome. We realized we could leverage Apple's Virtualization Framework to create a much better experience. Lumier takes a different approach: It uses Docker as a delivery mechanism (not for isolation) and connects to a lightweight virtualization service (lume) running on your Mac. Lumier is 100% open-source under MIT license and part of C/ua.

It landed #3 overall, right behind: - @ openai 4o - @ black-forest-labs Flux 1 Pro ...and just ahead of @ black-forest-labs Flux 1.1 Pro, @ xai-org Aurora and @ google Imagen3.
