MalayLM is also attractive for organizations wishing to preserve data privacy as it s efficiency allows it to run on a local machine. 🧠 MamayLM is trained on high-quality Ukrainian data and understands Ukrainian language, culture, and history. It is built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 9B model, but uses a number of new advances stemming from INSAIT’s experience in creating BgGPT, a Bulgarian LLM we released last year, now adopted nationwide and profiled several times by Google as a worldwide success case. 🤝 MamayLM is developed in a...</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:22:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hannayukhymenko/367157502110648</guid></item><item><title>New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/857345172218118</link><description>New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning “we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end.

Lastly, they also release a new benchmark again with self-supervision, they use an LLM to evaluate the detailed captions focusing on localization 👏 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:22:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/338904780470677</guid></item><item><title>SkyReels-V2 INFINITE VIDEO🔥♾️🎬 UNLIMITED duration video generation model  by Skywork.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/luigi12345/382493254979768</link><description>SkyReels-V2 INFINITE VIDEO🔥♾️🎬 UNLIMITED duration video generation model by Skywork. &gt; “Finally is here.

We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!

Not so fast.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/shekkizh/738330695730383</link><description>Think AGI is just around the corner? Not so fast. When OpenAI released its Computer-Using Agent (CUA) API, I happened to be playing Wordle 🧩 and thought, why not see how the model handles it? Spoiler: Wordle turned out to be a surprisingly effective benchmark. So Romain Cosentino Ph.D. and I dug in and analyzed the results of several hundred runs. 🔑 Takeaways 1️⃣ Even the best computer-using models struggle with simple, context-dependent tasks. 2️⃣ Visual perception and reasoning remain major hurdles for multimodal agents. 3️⃣ Real-world use cases reveal significant gaps between hype and reality. Perception accuracy drops to near zero by the last turn 📉 🔗 Read our arxiv article for more details https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2504.15434 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:22:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/shekkizh/738330695730383</guid></item><item><title>@SmallDoge</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/JingzeShi/736642176876033</link><description>@ SmallDoge SmallTalks( SmallDoge/SmallTalks ) is a synthetic dataset designed for supervised fine-tuning of language models.
