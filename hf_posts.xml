But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today. Here's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches: 1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -&gt; Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (2504.20769) Provides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs 2. Hybrid-CoT -&gt; AdaR1: From Long-CoT to Hybrid-CoT via Bi-Level Adaptive Reasoning Optimization (2504.21659) Proposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles 3.

C5 is a large-scale effort to heavily filter web-crawled data, as collected by the non-profit Common Crawl, to only documents that are Creative Commons-licensed such as cc-by-4.0 or public domain cc0. At this stage 150 billion tokens have been collected. --- 📄 data: BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons 🧰 software: https://github.com/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons --- &lt;/&gt; To build C5, HTML pages are scrutinized and all links (if any) to CC licenses are collected, both in regular hyperlinks as well as in metadata. Additional data fields are included such as "was the license found in the head ?" or "if multiple licenses were found, do they contradict each other?", which makes further filtering a breeze. 🌐 In this first version of C5, 8 languages are included (Afrikaans, German, English, French, Frysian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish). The language set was limited for two reasons: computational and storage limitations,...</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 17:20:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/BramVanroy/471518743184430</guid></item><item><title>🔮 Mistral Perflexity AI - Local LLM Space with Web Search Capabilities 🌐</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/917789522887291</link><description>🔮 Mistral Perflexity AI - Local LLM Space with Web Search Capabilities 🌐 Hello AI enthusiasts!

In response to that, I'm happy to present my final submission to the Reasoning Dataset Competition and attempt to start benchmarking the ability of LLMs to identify unsafe and / or exploitable code by way of the CoSa (Code Safety) benchmark: ZennyKenny/cosa-benchmark-dataset Currently a curated set of 200 examples, calibrated on OpenAI's standard issue models (GPT-4.1, o4 mini, and GPT-3.5 Turbo) as "baseline performance" (70% decile).
