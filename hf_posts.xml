But what happens when an AI tells you "I understand how you feel" and you actually believe it? At Hugging Face, together with @ frimelle and @ yjernite , we dug into something we felt wasn't getting enough attention: the need to evaluate AI companionship behaviors. These are the subtle ways AI systems validate us, engage with us, and sometimes manipulate our emotional lives. Here's what we found: 👉 Existing benchmarks (accuracy, helpfulness, safety) completely miss this emotional dimension. 👉 We mapped how leading AI systems actually respond to vulnerable prompts. 👉 We built the Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA): a first attempt at evaluating how models handle emotional dependency, boundaries, and attachment (with a full paper coming soon).

Today, we're highlighting crucial research that does just that by exposing a new vulnerability. The paper "Forget to Flourish" details a new model poisoning technique. It's a reminder that as we fine-tune LLMs, our anonymization and privacy strategies must evolve to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy dataset was instrumental in this study. It served two key purposes: Provided a Realistic Testbed: It gave the researchers access to a diverse set of synthetic and realistic PII samples in a safe, controlled environment. Enabled Impactful Benchmarking: It allowed them to measure the actual effectiveness of their data extraction attack, proving it could compromise specific, high-value information. This work reinforces our belief that progress in AI security is a community effort. By providing robust tools for benchmarking, we can collectively identify weaknesses and...</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 05:31:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/228428153197540</guid></item><item><title>Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 🔥 latest step in scaling thinking capabilities from  Alibaba Qwen team.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/263963364371914</link><description>Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 🔥 latest step in scaling thinking capabilities from Alibaba Qwen team.
