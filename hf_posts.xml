It has 130 different tasks grouped into 8 categories, like image search, classification, clustering similar images, answering questions based on images, and understanding documents. It even covers 38 different languages. The authors tested 50 models and found that no single model was best at everything. Some models were great at recognizing text inside images but struggled to handle complicated tasks like matching images and text that appear together.

Then the training is sequential 🔢 : 1. Freeze the LLM weights while you train the ViT only to work with the LLM part, then 2. Unfreeze all weights to train all weights in order to work together. 💫 The Shanghai Lab decided to challenge this paradigm and chose this approach that they call "native". For each of their model sizes, they still start from a good LLM (mostly Qwen-2.5 series, did I tell you I'm a huge fan of Qwen? ❤️), and stitch the ViT, but they don't freeze anything : they train all weights together with interleaved text and image...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:19:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/531366391123392</guid></item><item><title>Dropping an entire collection of Style Intermixing Adapters on StrangerZone HF — including Realism, Anime, Sketch, Texture-Rich 3D Experimentals, Automotive Concept Images, and LoRA models based on Flux.1, SD 3.5 Turbo/Large, Stable Diffusion XL 🎨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/567717355691306</link><description>Dropping an entire collection of Style Intermixing Adapters on StrangerZone HF — including Realism, Anime, Sketch, Texture-Rich 3D Experimentals, Automotive Concept Images, and LoRA models based on Flux.1, SD 3.5 Turbo/Large, Stable Diffusion XL 🎨 ╰┈➤Collection : ➜ sketch : strangerzonehf/sketch-fav-675ba869c7ceaec7e652ee1c ➜ sketch2 : strangerzonehf/q-series-sketch-678e3503bf3a661758429717 ➜ automotive : strangerzonehf/automotive-3d-675bb31a491d8c264d45d843 ➜ texture 3d : strangerzonehf/flux-3dxl-engine-674833c14a001d5b1fdb5139 ➜ super 3d : strangerzonehf/super-3d-engine-6743231d69f496df97addd2b ➜ style mix : strangerzonehf/mixer-engine-673582c9c5939d8aa5bf9533 ➜ realism : strangerzonehf/realism-engine-67343495b6daf0fbdb904cc1 ╰┈➤The Entire Collection : ➜ flux.1 : prithivMLmods/flux-lora-collections-66dd5908be2206cfaa8519be ➜ flux-ultimate-lora-collection : strangerzonehf/Flux-Ultimate-LoRA-Collection ➜ sd 3.5 large / turbo : prithivMLmods/sd-35-large-lora-671b39d7bc2e7f71a446b163...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:19:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/567717355691306</guid></item><item><title># 🚀 SE Arena: Evaluating Foundation Models for Software Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/zhiminy/357364609122297</link><description># 🚀 SE Arena: Evaluating Foundation Models for Software Engineering **SE Arena** is the first open-source platform for evaluating foundation models in real-world software engineering workflows. ## What makes it unique? - **RepoChat**: Automatically injects repository context (issues, commits, PRs) into conversations for more realistic evaluations - **Multi-round interactions**: Tests models through iterative workflows, not just single prompts - **Novel metrics**: Includes a "consistency score" that measures model determinism through self-play matches Try it now: SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena ## Why it matters Traditional evaluation frameworks don't capture how developers actually use models in their daily work. SE Arena creates a testing environment that mirrors real engineering workflows, helping you choose the right model for your specific software development needs.
