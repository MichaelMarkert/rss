These taxonomies break down jobs into tasks and skills, but they were built in a world before most work became digital-first, and long before generative AI could create marketing campaigns, voiceovers, or even whole professions in one step. That leaves us with a mismatch: we’re trying to measure the future of work with tools from the past. With @ yjernite we describe why these frameworks are falling increasingly short in the age of generative AI. We argue that instead of discarding taxonomies, we need to adapt them. Imagine taxonomies that: ✨ Capture new AI-native tasks and hybrid human-AI workflows ✨ Evolve dynamically as technology shifts ✨ Give workers a voice in deciding what gets automated and what stays human If we don’t act, we’ll keep measuring the wrong things. If we do, we can design...</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:25:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/frimelle/763316628765853</guid></item><item><title>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</link><description>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure 1/ no more long waits before seeing model support status 2/ ready-to-use CLI and Python snippets 3/ redirection to Azure AI Foundry rather than Azure ML ✋ if you see any bugs or have feedback, open an issue on our repo: https://github.com/huggingface/Microsoft-Azure See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:25:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</guid></item><item><title>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</link><description>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team ByteDance-Seed/seed-oss-68a609f4201e788db05b5dcd ✨ 36B - Base &amp; Instruct ✨ Apache 2.0 ✨ Native 512K long context ✨ Strong reasoning &amp; agentic intelligence ✨ 2 Base versions: with &amp; without synthetic data See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:25:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</guid></item><item><title>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/826512832075444</link><description>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Tutorial Video : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Wan 2.2, Qwen Image, FLUX, FLUX Krea, all these models are the SOTA open-source models and in this master tutorial I will show you how to use these models in the easiest, most performant, and most accurate way.
