It works offline, zero cloud, zero internet, zero EU AI Act anxiety. No limit with all tokens on the house. It’s not great, not terrible- adequate performance for an on device AI agent chewing through code on a 1.24 kg laptop. I wrote an interpreter to broker peace between Claude Code and my local AI runtime. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it’s aligned with the company that owns it.

Qwen-Image, a 20B MMDiT model for next-generation text-to-image generation, preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. It is especially strong at creating stunning graphic posters with native text. The model is now open-source.

The model supports a wide range of vision-related tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and image super-resolution. While each task is technically distinct, they can all be viewed...</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/372876915549424</guid></item><item><title>Finaly OpenAI is open to share open-source models after GPT2-2019.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ImranzamanML/667361724381561</link><description>Finaly OpenAI is open to share open-source models after GPT2-2019. gpt-oss-120b gpt-oss-20b openai/gpt-oss-120b #AI #GPT #LLM #Openai See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ImranzamanML/667361724381561</guid></item><item><title>Trainable selective sampling and sparse attention kernels are indispensable in the era of context engineering.

My skepticism circuits overloaded, but my local AI FOMO module screamed louder. I've thrown this 33B monoblock LLM onto a single GPU and used Roo Code for some… let’s call it “vibe testing”. It’s terrifyingly competent. As an architect, it’s the best open-weight model I’ve touched this side of 2025.
