A month ago there were 5,500 users/orgs on Xet with 150K repos and 4PB. Today? ü§ó 700,000 users/orgs üìà 350,000 repos üöÄ 15PB Meanwhile, our migrations have pushed throughput to numbers that are bonkers. In June, we hit upload speeds of 577Gb/s (crossing 500Gb/s for the first time). These are hard numbers to put into context, but let's try: The latest run of the Common Crawl from commoncrawl was 471 TB. We now have ~32 crawls stored in Xet. At peak upload speed we could move the latest crawl into Xet in about two hours. We're moving to a new phase in the process, so stay tuned. This shift in gears means it's also time to roll up our sleeves and look at all the bytes we have and the value we're adding to the community. I already have some homework from @ RichardErkhov to look at the dedupe across their uploads, and I'll be doing...</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:19:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/866221600890917</guid></item><item><title>Three big AI copyright updates this week alone.

In case you haven't come across it, you can get started with Kontext using ü§ó diffusers. See the official [model]( black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev ) and [docs]( https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/flux#flux ). Want to know how inference companies like Fal &amp; Replicate are able to run the model so fast and in under 2 seconds per image? Check out this [gist]( https://gist.github.com/a-r-r-o-w/d08c37e8bd3e9c26b4ce80360be148c6 ) for some details!
