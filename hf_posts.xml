I recently stumbled upon a medical domain-specific FACTS Grounding leaderboard on Hugging Face, and the approach to evaluating AI accuracy in medical contexts is quite impressive, so I thought I'd share. 📊 What is FACTS Grounding? It's originally a benchmark developed by Google DeepMind that measures how well LLMs generate answers based solely on provided documents. What's cool about this medical-focused version is that it's designed to test even small open-source models. 🏥 Medical Domain Version Features 236 medical examples: Extracted from the original 860 examples Tests small models like Qwen 3 1.7B: Great for resource-constrained environments Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash for evaluation: Simplified to a single judge model 📈 The Evaluation Method is Pretty Neat Grounding Score: Are all claims in the response supported by the provided document? Quality Score: Does it properly answer the user's question? Combined Score:...</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 05:22:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/221417890817416</guid></item><item><title>We have been working on a project called</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danieldk/385505075920135</link><description>We have been working on a project called kernels . kernels makes it possible to load compute kernels directly from the Hub! 🚀 We plan to give kernels a more proper introduction soon.
