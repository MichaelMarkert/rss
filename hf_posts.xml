Today, we announce Mistral 3, the next generation of Mistral models. Mistral 3 includes three state-of-the-art small, dense models (14B, 8B, and 3B) and Mistral Large 3 – our most capable model to date – a sparse mixture-of-experts trained with 41B active and 675B total parameters. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

ScalingOpt is a professional platform focusing on optimization for large-scale deep learning, aiming to advocate for "Optimization at Scale," which means verifiable and scalable optimization algorithms. This community platform is dedicated to gathering, discovering, comparing, and contributing various cutting-edge optimizers and optimization algorithms. It's not just a simple Awesome List, it also includes: Visualizations: Covers visualization scripts for the Rosenbrock Function and the Rastrigin Function for users to freely explore. Benchmark: We recommend Algoperf as the primary source, along with other verifiable benchmarks and analysis articles, for users to reference the best optimizer. Papers &amp; Blogs Recommendation: The platform summarizes high-quality papers and blogs from recent years, and continuously adds the latest papers based on daily arXiv updates, currently totaling nearly a hundred articles....</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 05:25:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Juanxi/977874890039450</guid></item><item><title>ICYMI, transformers v5 is out!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/920736659206393</link><description>ICYMI, transformers v5 is out!
