The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, "Whispered Tuning", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. 🔗 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:53:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</guid></item><item><title>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/790273915312125</link><description>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena. 🏆 The Champions: Claude-Opus-4.5, Gemini-3-Pro, GPT-5.2, and Gemini-3-Flash sweep the top four spots. 🚀 The Pursuers: Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.2 tie for first place among Chinese models; GLM-4.7, ERNIE-5.0, and Kimi secure their positions in the domestic top five. 🔥 The Biggest Highlight: The top three spots on the open-source leaderboard are entirely held by Team China (DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), outperforming the best western open-source models.

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

The goal of this project is to build a decision-support tool for recruiters that doesn’t just “sound confident,” but can actually explain why it produces a given recommendation. Link: 19arjun89/AI_Recruiting_Agent Over the last few iterations, I’ve focused on three areas: 1) Deterministic Verification of Job Requirements (Skills) Previously, required skills were extracted by an LLM from the job description. While this worked well, it still relied heavily on model behavior. I’ve now added a verification layer that: Requires every “required” skill to be backed by a verbatim quote from the job description This means hallucinated skills are explicitly detected and removed before scoring. The system now shows: What the model extracted What was verified What...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:53:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/19arjun89/812902911486628</guid></item><item><title>Not for everybody, but the absolute mad craze about clawdbot/moltbook the last couple of days reminded me of a short story I wrote in 2018 (ancient times!).</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/neph1/280223950636420</link><description>Not for everybody, but the absolute mad craze about clawdbot/moltbook the last couple of days reminded me of a short story I wrote in 2018 (ancient times!).
