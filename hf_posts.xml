We‚Äôve just released the results from a large-scale human evaluation (400k annotations) of OpenGVLab‚Äôs newest text-to-image model, Lumina. Surprisingly, Lumina outperforms OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E 3 in terms of alignment, although it ranks #6 in our overall human preference benchmark. To support further development in text-to-image models, we‚Äôre making our entire human-annotated dataset publicly available. If you‚Äôre working on model improvements and need high-quality data, feel free to explore. We welcome your feedback and look forward to any insights you might share!

Unlike traditional embedding models that directly match queries with documents, O1 Embedder first generates thoughtful reflections about the query before performing retrieval. This two-step process significantly improves performance on complex retrieval tasks, especially those requiring intensive reasoning or zero-shot generalization to new domains. The technical implementation is fascinating: - The model integrates two essential functions: Thinking and Embedding - It uses an "Exploration-Refinement" data synthesis workflow where initial thoughts are generated by an LLM and refined by a retrieval committee - A multi-task training method fine-tunes a pre-trained...</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:22:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/419917039256941</guid></item><item><title>Quick POC: Turn a Hugging Face dataset card into a short podcast introducing the dataset using all open models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/855251141208457</link><description>Quick POC: Turn a Hugging Face dataset card into a short podcast introducing the dataset using all open models.

Important steps: Good idea is to start with a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installation with latest CUDA 12.8 and the open NVIDIA driver - follow more advices from [2]: sudo apt -y install cuda-toolkit-12-8 nvidia-open I tried update from an existing Ubuntu installation with an older CUDA and driver version and it resulted in a non-startable system. If you are using PyTorch 2.6 with built CUDA 12.6 it will result in: NVIDIA Graphics Device with CUDA capability sm_120 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation. The current PyTorch install supports CUDA capabilities sm_50 sm_60 sm_70 sm_75 sm_80 sm_86 sm_90. But no worries! For PyTorch you need just to use a nightly 2.7 version...</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:22:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/stefan-it/989004577410802</guid></item><item><title>Is this the best tool to extract clean info from PDFs, handwriting and complex documents yet?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/636972739498133</link><description>Is this the best tool to extract clean info from PDFs, handwriting and complex documents yet? Open source olmOCR just dropped and the results are impressive. Tested the free demo with various documents, including a handwritten Claes Oldenburg letter. The speed is impressive: 3000 tokens/second on your own GPU - that's 1/32 the cost of GPT-4o ($190/million pages). Game-changer for content extraction and digital archives. To achieve this, Ai2 trained a 7B vision language model on 260K pages from 100K PDFs using "document anchoring" - combining PDF metadata with page images. Best part: it actually understands document structure (columns, tables, equations) instead of just jumbling everything together like most OCR tools. Their human eval results back this up. üëâ Try the demo: https://olmocr.allenai.org Going right into the AI toolkit: JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:22:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/636972739498133</guid></item><item><title>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</link><description>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2, with a single-label classification problem type! üåÄüß§ - AI vs Deepfake vs Real : prithivMLmods/AI-vs-Deepfake-vs-Real-Siglip2 - Deepfake Detect : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Detect-Siglip2 - Fire Detection : prithivMLmods/Fire-Detection-Siglip2 - Deepfake Quality Assess : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Quality-Assess-Siglip2 - Guard Against Unsafe Content : prithivMLmods/Guard-Against-Unsafe-Content-Siglip2 üå†Collection : prithivMLmods/siglip2-custom-67bcdb2de8fe96b99fb4e19e See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:22:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</guid></item><item><title>What if AI becomes as ubiquitous as the internet, but runs locally and transparently on our devices?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/113970261627099</link><description>What if AI becomes as ubiquitous as the internet, but runs locally and transparently on our devices? Fascinating TED talk by @ thomwolf on open source AI and its future impact. Imagine this for AI: instead of black box models running in distant data centers, we get transparent AI that runs locally on our phones and laptops, often without needing internet access. If the original team moves on? No problem - resilience is one of the beauties of open source. Anyone (companies, collectives, or individuals) can adapt and fix these models. This is a compelling vision of AI's future that solves many of today's concerns around AI transparency and centralized control.
