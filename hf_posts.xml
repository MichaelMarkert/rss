The most notable regression vs the base model here is in arithmetic - if your workload is math heavy this model demonstrates an unfortunate collapse with performance under growing complexity. The interesting combination of awesome overall performance on SVG simple shapes identification coupled with a total inability to recognize more complex shapes like 'House' or 'Arrow' is a behavior directly inherited from the base model (but with a ~20% improvement in token utilization). If you like your reasoning models token-efficient, Aquif-3.5-8B-Think is well worth a spin.

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐋𝐄𝐁 — 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤. A suite of 10 high-quality English legal IR datasets, designed by legal experts to set a new standard for comparing embedding models. Whether you’re exploring legal RAG on your home computer, or running enterprise-scale retrieval, apples-to-apples evaluation is crucial. That’s why we’ve open-sourced everything - including our 7 brand-new, hand-crafted retrieval datasets. All of these datasets are now live on Hugging Face. Any guesses which embedding model leads on legal retrieval? 𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐭: it’s not OpenAI or Google - they place 7th and 9th on our leaderboard. To do well on MLEB, embedding models must demonstrate both extensive legal domain knowledge and strong legal reasoning skills. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 17:19:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abdurrahmanbutler/994710514786612</guid></item><item><title>MLEB  is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</link><description>MLEB is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 17:19:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</guid></item><item><title>AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/wenhuach/917073841450527</link><description>AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! 🚀 After enhancing W2A16 quantization, we now offer a fast algorithm to generate mixed bits/data-type schemes (~2mins for 8B models), great for MXFP4 and W2A16.

A rather interesting attribute of these models is I have absolutely no idea what they are fine-tuned from, other then some kind of pre-small Mistrals! The non-nemo 15b looks like Mistral Pixtral 12B, but with 8 more layers while the nemo 15b analogously looks like Mistral NeMo 12B but with 10 more layers and a smaller max context length. The performance trade-offs between these two models are quite clear: the Nemotron provides ~30% shorter answers but at the expense of totally collapsing under difficulty on 4 of the 12 tasks ... which all just happen to have "Math" in common, so it's pretty easy to point the finger at exactly what the price for the lower reasoning token usage is here.

But at GoDaddy, we’re going deeper: starting from first principles to explore what makes an agent truly robust and usable in real-world scenarios. Instead of asking “What can we build fast?” we’re asking “What design choices make agents flexible, testable, and reliable long term?” Core Concepts • Tool-centric design: everything an agent does is a tool call, with precise APIs and granularity. • Decision vs. delivery: agents decide what to do; tools handle how to do it—keeping systems modular. • Structured outputs &amp; reflection: LLMs output both the tool call and the reason behind it, making debugging and iteration easier. • Universal tools: even user interactions (inform, confirm, request) are abstracted as tools, clarifying boundaries between logic and interface.
