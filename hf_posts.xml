Diffusers just added support for another caching method: First Block Cache - a technique developed by @ chengzeyi building upon the ideas of TeaCache. The idea in short is: if the model predictions do not vary much over successive inference steps, we can skip certain steps where the prediction difference is small. To figure out whether an inference step will make a significant improvement to the overall velocity/noise prediction, we calculate the relative difference of the output of the first transformer block at timestep $t$ with $t-1$, and compare it against a selected threshold. If the difference is lower than the threshold, we skip the step. A higher threshold will lead to more steps being skipped. However, skipping many steps is bad because it can throw off the model predictions, and so we need to test and select the threshold based on level of quality-speed tradeoff...</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:28:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/278025275110164</guid></item><item><title>How to achieve 100% Pass Rate on HumanEval ? üî•</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/789674491872223</link><description>How to achieve 100% Pass Rate on HumanEval ? üî• Meet MGDebugger if you are tired of LLMs failing on complex bugs ü§î Our MGDebugger, just hit 100% accuracy on HumanEval using the DeepSeek-R1 model. üöÄ ‚ú® Demo: learnmlf/MGDebugger üìù Paper: From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging (2410.01215) üíª Code: https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger HumanEval may be retired, we're ready for the next challenge In more complex scenarios!

The current model places impossible burdens on users to manage countless consent decisions. Meanwhile, AI systems learn to mimic our voices and writing styles from data we unknowingly provided years ago. What's next? We need to shift from individual responsibility to collective accountability. This means: - Organizations designing systems that respect human agency by default - Developers building ethics into models from the start - Policymakers creating frameworks beyond minimal compliance Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/consentful-ai Paper: Can AI be Consentful?

Inception Labs was founded a few months ago, and they're not sleeping: after dropping a code model, they just published Mercury chat, a diffusion-based chat model that reaches 1000 tokens / second on H100, i.e. 10x more than models of equivalent performance on the same hardware! What's the breakthrough? Well instead, of generating tokens left-to-right like the more common autoregressive LLMs, diffusion models generate their blocks of text all at once, and successive steps refine the whole text. Diffusion models being really fast at isn't new, we have had some promising results on this by Google already back in May with Gemini Diffusion, and Mercury themselves had already published their coding model a few months ago But being that good quality is new - and now Inception Labs just proved that their models work well in chat...</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:28:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/129069007859083</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ For those who interested in summarization of the long textual reports in medical domain  üìùü©∫,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/221275408085007</link><description>üöÄ For those who interested in summarization of the long textual reports in medical domain üìùü©∫, @ Xiaolihai and I delighted to share that we experiment with distillation tuning adaptation for Qwen-2.5 0.5B. We use reports from the MultiClinSum dataset and pass it through 72B version to retrieve report explanations in order to initiate ditillation tuning for 0.5B model. We experiment with passages written in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. üîë We find that using distil-technique results in 2-4% performance increment on fine-tuning and similar improvements for reports in English (non-official and official evaluation). For the other it results in systems that perform similar to the convential tuning (standard) (see result below).
