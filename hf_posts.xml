With native whopping 2560x2560 pixels image output capability and with only 12 steps it is next level. With our installers and specially made Quant FP8 Scaled model, you can run this amazing beast even as low as 6 GB GPUs. In this tutorial, I have compared Qwen Image Edit 2511 with previous successor model Qwen Image 2509 with 12 different unique and hard prompts and cases. Everything is step by step explained and provided.

Key findings from our research on optimal architectures for small language models: → Depth beats width: 32 layers outperforms 12 layers at the same parameter count → Best-in-class factuality: 47.5% on TruthfulQA → 10x training efficiency using WSD (Warmup-Stable-Decay) conversion → Canon layers add only 0.13% parameters but improve reasoning We trained on 1B tokens using the optimal 50-30-20 dataset mix (PDFs + filtered web + educational content), then converted to diffusion with just 100M additional tokens.

That said, we know many developers are comfortable with the classic layout (Postman / Bruno-style), where multiple sections can stay open at once.What would you prefer? - A new, focused single-section layout - The classic multi-section layout - A toggle that lets you choose between both?

A new paper reports it's possible. The "Attractive Metadata Attack" paper details this stealthy new threat. To measure the real-world impact of their attack, the researchers needed a source of sensitive data for the agent to leak. We're proud that the AI4Privacy corpus was used to create the synthetic user profiles containing standardized PII for their experiments. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helped researchers Kanghua Mo, 龙昱丞, Zhihao Li from Guangzhou University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to not just demonstrate a new attack, but also quantify its potential for harm. This data-driven evidence is what pushes the community to build better, execution-level defenses for AI agents. 🔗 Check out their paper to see how easily an agent's trust in tool metadata could be exploited: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110 #OpenSource #DataPrivacy #LLM #Anonymization...</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:21:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/284489022074040</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Article: *Hardware Paths for Structured Intelligence* (Draft v0.1)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/731781965803753</link><description>✅ New Article: *Hardware Paths for Structured Intelligence* (Draft v0.1) Title: 🧩 From CPUs to SI-GSPU: Hardware Paths for Structured Intelligence 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/hardware-paths-for-si --- Summary: Most “AI hardware” is built for dense matrix math. But real-world intelligence systems bottleneck elsewhere: **semantic parsing, structured memory, governance checks, auditability, and evaluation loops** — the parts that turn models into safe, resilient systems. This article maps the gap clearly, and sketches how a future **SI-GSPU class accelerator** fits: not “a better GPU,” but a co-processor for **semantics + governance runtime**. &gt; GPUs carry the models. &gt; S I-GSPU carries the rules that decide when models are allowed to act. --- Why It Matters: • Explains *why* “more GPU” doesn’t fix governance-heavy AI stacks • Identifies what to accelerate: semantic transforms, memory ops, coverage/metrics, effect ledgers • Shows how to build **SI-GSPU-ready** systems...</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:21:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/731781965803753</guid></item><item><title>OpenAPI specs are a great way to describe APIs in a clear, standard format.

They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.
