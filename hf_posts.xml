Our v2.0 quants set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU and KL Divergence, meaning you can now run &amp; fine-tune quantized LLMs while preserving as much accuracy as possible. Llama 4: unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct-GGUF DeepSeek-R1: unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-UD Gemma 3: unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF We made selective layer quantization much smarter. Instead of modifying only a subset of layers, we now dynamically quantize all layers so every layer has a different bit. Now, our dynamic method can be applied to all LLM architectures, not just MoE's. Blog with Details: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/dynamic-v2.0 All our future GGUF uploads will leverage Dynamic 2.0 and our hand curated 300K‚Äì1.5M token calibration dataset to improve conversational chat performance. For accurate benchmarking, we built an evaluation framework to match the reported 5-shot MMLU scores of Llama 4 and Gemma 3. This allowed apples-to-apples comparisons between full-...</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:31:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/766411311755038</guid></item><item><title>ComfyUI 1-click Installers updated for latest official Torch 2.7 with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5000 series support + older GPUs) - Automatically installs xFormers, Flash Attention, Sage Attention, Triton, DeepSpeed, insightface, accelerate, onnxruntime-gpu for Windows</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/127802170120239</link><description>ComfyUI 1-click Installers updated for latest official Torch 2.7 with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5000 series support + older GPUs) - Automatically installs xFormers, Flash Attention, Sage Attention, Triton, DeepSpeed, insightface, accelerate, onnxruntime-gpu for Windows 1-click Installers zip file is here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/105023709 xFormers compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) and Linux (Python 3.10 only) Flash Attention compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) and Linux (Python 3.10 only) Sage Attention compiled by me for Linux (Python 3.10 only) insightface compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) Pre-compiled Triton + Sage Attention + DeepSpeed installed for Windows You must have pre-installed Python on your system manually Tutorial for Python + CUDA 12.8 installation : https://youtu.be/DrhUHnYfwC0 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:31:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/127802170120239</guid></item><item><title>FlowReasoner is a new system that builds a custom set of small AI agents for every user question.

I've been diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol) to understand what the hype was all about. It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that can be hooked to LLMs. But while doing that, came my second realization: Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. ü§Ø ‚û°Ô∏è read it exclusively on the official HF blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:31:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176</guid></item><item><title>6 Free resources on Reinforcement Learning (RL)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/484268922176188</link><description>6 Free resources on Reinforcement Learning (RL) RL now is where the real action is, it's the engine behind autonomous tech, robots, and the next wave of AI that thinks, moves and solves problems on its own. To stay up to date with what‚Äôs happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert -&gt; https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. "A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -&gt; https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It‚Äôs packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3.
