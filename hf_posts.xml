I have done over 64 different unique Wan 2.2 trainings to prepare the very best working training configurations for you. The configurations are fully working locally with as low as 6 GB GPUs. So you will be able to train your awesome Wan 2.2 image or video generation LoRAs on your Windows computer with easiness. Moreover, I have shown how to train on cloud platforms RunPod and Massed Compute so even if you have no GPU or you want faster training, you can train on cloud for very cheap prices fully privately.

Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:28:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314</guid></item><item><title>OpenAPI specs are a great way to describe APIs in a clear, standard format.

They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.

You need a smart sanitizer. A new system called Prϵϵmpt shows how. The first, critical step in their solution is a high-performance Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to find the sensitive data. We're proud to see that these researchers, Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, and Mihir Bellare from the University of Michigan, University of Toronto, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California, San Diego - Rady School of Management and Langroid Incorporated fine-tuned their NER model on 10 high-risk categories from the AI4Privacy dataset. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helps provide the foundation for the critical detection engine, which in turn enables the community to build and test better solutions like Prϵϵmpt's innovative use of encryption and Differential Privacy. 🔗 Check out their paper for a deep dive into a formally private,...</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:28:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/649372647638290</guid></item></channel></rss>
