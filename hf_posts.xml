This video highlights the power of real-time AI brushwork, dynamic color composition, and fluid scene construction — all generated using my custom Miragic Speed Painting engine. What This Demo Shows - Ultra-fast painting generation from start to finish - Smooth, natural brushstrokes that feel hand-drawn - Stable composition and color consistency - A cinematic visual style suitable for creative projects - No diffusion-style noise or randomness — just pure painting Speed painting is perfect for: - Content creators and video editors - Graphic designers and social media marketers - Artists exploring quick concepts - Businesses needing fast creative assets - Anyone who wants beautiful visuals… without waiting minutes or hours Watch the Video I’ve attached the full speed...</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:22:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/wang12390/386545539363465</guid></item><item><title>🗣️ Introducing the Duality AI +  LunateAI Challenge- Geospatial Object Detection: Rural Buildings!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/527488277094596</link><description>🗣️ Introducing the Duality AI + LunateAI Challenge- Geospatial Object Detection: Rural Buildings! Train a model to detect difficult detection instances, such as a low number of pixels or weak feature responses, in rural aerial imagery, to win 🏆PRIZES🏆 and 🤩RECOGNITION🤩. Sign up here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/duality-ai-lunate-ai-geospatial-object-detection/overview This is the first competition in the 🌎Geospatial Kaggle Challenge Series🌏, which will explore how geospatial-based digital twins can train an AI model for real-world applications. Duality is excited to be partnering with LunateAI, a high-end advisory business founded by the award-winning, industry-recognized global leader Dr. Nadine Alameh to usher in a new era of geospatial impact in conjunction with advances in computing and AI. Lunate helps government and industry leaders 🤔 rethink, 💡redesign, and 📝 execute transformative geospatial strategies using AI, cloud, and Lunate’s unparalleled global expertise.

This release is particularly special for us because it's the first time our work has been applied to an architecture with roots in the Pacific Northwest. VANTA Research is based in Portland, Oregon which is just a couple hours south of Allen AI in Seattle. Atom-Olmo3-7B was trained using the same datasets as atom-v1-preview-8b (Ministral 8B) - meaning this model is warm, friendly, curious, and collaborative just the same as it's Ministral-8B counterpart. Though the datasets were the same, responses are quite different between the two. Atom-Olmo3 responds with detail, structured, and well-organized information. Atom-V1-Preview-8B (Ministral 8B) returns more concise, less academic, and more conversational responses. Both models are native in human-AI collaboration and exploratory learning - though they each present it...</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:22:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/762230736035210</guid></item><item><title>Publishing our research on dual-motor backlash compensation for STS3215 servos.

Is your model implementation behaving badly like this?
