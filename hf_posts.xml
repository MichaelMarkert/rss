Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

So we’ve made 2 notebook for abliterating any model in order to achieve a good model that will actually help you! The notebooks are made using @ mlabonne ‘s abliteration logic and datasets! Feel free to use them and happy training 😊 https://github.com/dralexlup/LLM-Abliteration See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</guid></item><item><title>The past year I have been trying to get diffusion models to work for language generation, without having to retrain a LLM from scratch.

And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. 🎯 Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! 🧠 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>C/ua Cloud Containers  - Docker for Computer-Use Agents.

It combines the sharp detection of YOLOv8, the semantic awareness of CLIP, the environmental grounding of Places365, and the expressive fluency of Llama 3.2. Together, they deliver more than bounding boxes, they produce rich narratives about layout, lighting, activities, and contextual cues. 🏞️ For example: - CLIP’s zero-shot capability recognizes cultural landmarks without any task-specific training - Places365 helps anchor the scene into one of 365 categories, refining lighting interpretation and spatial understanding. It also assists in distinguishing indoor vs. outdoor scenes and enables lighting condition classification such as “sunset”, “sunrise”, or “indoor commercial” - Llama 3.2 turns structured analysis into human-readable, context-rich...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/336678978162593</guid></item><item><title>RedNote 小红书  just released their first LLM 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/611247032364638</link><description>RedNote 小红书 just released their first LLM 🔥 dots.llm1.base 🪐 a 142B MoE model with only 14B active params. rednote-hilab/dotsllm1-68246aaaaba3363374a8aa7c ✨ Base &amp; Instruct - MIT license ✨ Trained on 11.2T non-synthetic high-quality data ✨ Competitive with Qwen2.5/3 on reasoning, code, alignment See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/611247032364638</guid></item><item><title>New models from Qwen 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/473255162200609</link><description>New models from Qwen 🔥 Qwen3-Embedding and Qwen3-Reranker Series just released on the hub by Alibaba Qwen team. ✨ 0.6B/ 4B/ 8B with Apache2.0 ✨ Supports 119 languages 🤯 ✨ Top-tier performance: Leading the MTEB multilingual leaderboard！ Reranker: Qwen/qwen3-reranker-6841b22d0192d7ade9cdefea Embedding: Qwen/qwen3-embedding-6841b2055b99c44d9a4c371f See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/473255162200609</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/zamal/148346638153657</link><description>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️ A powerful, modular toolkit for intelligent video manipulation and scene editing.
