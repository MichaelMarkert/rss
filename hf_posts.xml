It is an advanced LoRA adaptation of the Qwen-Image model and an upgraded version of prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism , offering more precise portrait rendering with a strong focus on realism. The model was trained on diverse face types from across the world, labeled with florence2-en and caption-optimized using prithivMLmods/DeepCaption-VLA-7B . 11(types) × 5 different face types: Asian, Hispanic, Caucasian, Latina, Middle Eastern, etc. ⮞ Model🤗: prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-HeadshotX ⮞ The Previous Adapter (LoRA): prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism ⮞ Collection: prithivMLmods/qwen-image-exp-lora-68a978fe11400bc3165b0c4d . . .

This field is evolving quickly, moving far beyond classics like PPO and GRPO. So here is our overview of 10 newest PO methods: 1. Pref-GRPO → Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning (2508.20751) Stabilizes text-to-image reinforcement learning (RL) with pairwise preference rewards and a unified UNIGENBENCH benchmark 2. PVPO (Policy with Value Preference Optimization) → PVPO: Pre-Estimated Value-Based Policy Optimization for Agentic Reasoning (2508.21104) This critic-free RL method uses a pre-trained model as a reference anchor to reduce bias and guide learning, selecting high-value examples through data pre-sampling 3. DCPO (Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization) → DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (2509.02333) Uses dynamic clipping,...</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:16:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/304021452230579</guid></item><item><title>Cua: Best State-of-the-Art Computer-Use Agent</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/362032292361583</link><description>Cua: Best State-of-the-Art Computer-Use Agent Build a SOTA Computer-Use Agent using Cua ( https://github.com/trycua/cua ), the open-source infrastructure and agent framework for controlling real desktop and browser environments.
