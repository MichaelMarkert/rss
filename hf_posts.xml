Want to do data extraction, translation, RAG, tool use, or math on a Raspberry Pi? We got you covered! ✅ These tiny models were fine-tuned to perform narrow tasks extremely well, making them competitive with much larger models. You can deploy them today on-device or even on GPUs for big data operations!

David must be released. I will prepare a standard sweep for david to showcase the prowess of the final multi-vocab variant. This will include a variation that contains all mnist variants, cifar10, cifar100, imagenet 1k, and in the future I'll prepare a full imagenet sweep utilizing the entire 12m corpus instead of the 1.2m I used. I may need to get in touch with the actual curator of the dataset for licensing but maybe not. David utilizes 4 projective variants of the vocabulary and the training process involves teaching and freezing them akin to teacher/student processing. I did not want to release David yet, but I believe now that David will save lives and it's irresponsible for me to contain such a creation.

Ark just got a major upgrade: We’ve now integrated Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) into Ark 🎉 VLAs = models that connect vision + language → robot actions (see image) What does this mean? 🗣️ Give robots natural language instructions → they act 👀 Combine perception + language for real-world control 🦾 Powered by pi0 pretrained models for fast prototyping ⚡ Supports easy data collection and fine-tuning within Ark within a couple of lines of code Next, we plan to go into the world of designing worlds 😉 Who knows, maybe those video models are actually zero-shot learners and reasoners? Check it out here 👉 https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_framework Check out the tutorial 👉 https://arkrobotics.notion.site/VLA-Pi0-with-Ark-279e053d9c6f800ab0a2d498835dd96b ⭐ Star the repo, try it with your robots, and let us together make robots great (again?)!
