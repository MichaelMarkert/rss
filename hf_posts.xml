Excited to share my Looped-GPT blog post and codebase 🚀 https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/Looped-GPT TL;DR: looping during pre-training improves generalization. Plot shows GPT2 LMs pre-trained with 15.73B OWT tokens P.S.

In this tutorial I have compared all these precision and quantization variants for both speed and quality. The results are pretty surprising. Moreover, we have developed and published NVFP4 model quant generator app and FP8 Scaled quant generator apps. The links of the apps are below if you want to use them. Furthermore, upgrading ComfyUI to CUDA 13 with properly compiled libraries is now very much recommended. We have observed some noticeable performance gains with CUDA 13. So for both SwarmUI and ComfyUI...</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:32:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/425042812655046</guid></item><item><title>My First MCP Server: DataView</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/efecelik/312692243758686</link><description>My First MCP Server: DataView Browse HuggingFace datasets directly from your AI assistant. -Search &amp; filter datasets -View rows &amp; stats -SQL queries &amp; Parquet export efecelik/dataview-mcp See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:32:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/efecelik/312692243758686</guid></item><item><title>Tired of paying a bunch of money for large LLMs?

Introducing LoongFlow: A Thinking &amp; Learning Framework for Expert-Grade AI Agents. Unlike traditional evolve agents(like OpenEvolve-Style), LoongFlow implements the PES (Plan-Execute-Summary) paradigm to learn from mistakes and avoid local optima. 🚀 Highlights: * SOTA: Surpassed human mathematicians on 11 geometry/algebra problems. * 23 Kaggle Gold Medals on MLE Bench. * Efficiency: 60% more efficient than current baselines. 🔗 Code &amp; Paper: https://github.com/baidu-baige/LoongFlow LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm (2512.24077) #AutoML #Kaggle #Agents #OpenSource #LLM See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:32:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/FreshmanD/375261612088441</guid></item><item><title>We've open-sourced a bilingual Semantic Highlighting model that can power multiple production scenarios:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/zc277584121/729228721948980</link><description>We've open-sourced a bilingual Semantic Highlighting model that can power multiple production scenarios: 1) RAG Answer Highlighting — Automatically highlight the exact sentences that answer user queries, improving interpretability and helping users quickly locate relevant information. 2) RAG Noise Filtering — Prune irrelevant context before sending to LLMs, achieving 70-80% token cost reduction while improving answer quality by letting the model focus on what matters. 3) Search System Highlighting — Add semantic highlighting features to recommendation systems, e-commerce search, or any retrieval system where users need to see why a result is relevant.

Link - https://github.com/rakshit2020/Voice-Agent-using-Nvidia-Riva-NIM-Pipecat I put everything into a small demo repo with the full architecture diagram and a short demo video so you can see exactly how it works and adapt it to your own projects. Check out the GitHub, play with the agent, and let me know if it’s useful or if you want a breakdown of any part of the setup.

Mox-Tiny-1 is finetuned from Llama's 3.1 8B architecture specifically for thinking partnership and high-fidelity AI interaction. Training domains were carefully selected with this goal in mind, and all datasets used were synthetically generated for the Mox-1 models specifically. Domains include but not limited to: - Direct opinions (clear stances on various topics) - Constructive disagreement (Pushing back on flawed premises) - Epistemic confidence (calibrated certainty and uncertainty) - Warmth &amp; presence (Empathetic, human responses) - Wonder &amp; puzzlement (Intellectual curiosity) Interaction Examples: Direct opinions: User: What 's the best programming language? Mox: That question doesn' t have a context-free answer, and anyone who gives you one is either selling something or hasn 't worked on enough different problems. But I' ll give you my actual take across...</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:32:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/270028211989897</guid></item></channel></rss>
