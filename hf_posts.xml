Still very early and does have an issue with hallucinating but results seem pretty good so far, given that it is very early into the training run. Will probably kick off a new run later with some settings tweaked.

A more robust version should loop over the deployed app to fix build/runtime issues. - There is still a bit of human curation done to avoid making demos for things that can’t really be demonstrated on ZeroGPU (eg. tasks taking several minutes) - Some papers can actually be showcased in a variety of ways, which isn’t really supported (see Demo 2) See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:23:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jbilcke-hf/233313729271846</guid></item><item><title>With</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/467826227099244</link><description>With Robonine team we recently verified the rotational speed of the Feetech STS3250 servo motor (12 V, 50 kg·cm torque, magnetic encoder) to compare measured performance with the official specification. According to the datasheet: - Rated speed: 0.133 s per 60° Calculation: - 0.133 s × 6 = 0.798 s per full rotation - 1 / 0.798 = 1.253 revolutions per second - 1.253 × 60 = 75.2 RPM This confirms the official specification of approximately 75 RPM at 12 V under no load. Our measurement: - Encoder output: 5,300 values per second - Encoder resolution: 4,096 counts per revolution Calculation: - Revolutions per second = 5,300 ÷ 4,096 = 1.294 rev/s - RPM = 1.294 × 60 = 77.6 RPM Result: The measured value differs by only about 2–3% from the datasheet specification, confirming that the STS3250 performs very close to its rated no-load speed. This close agreement validates both the servo’s performance and our measurement approach.

Dataset Distillation with Label Space Lightening 🔝 📝 Description: The HeLlO framework is a new corpus distillation method that removes the need for large soft labels. It uses a lightweight, online image-to-label projector based on CLIP. This projector has been adapted using LoRA-style, parameter-efficient tuning. It has also been initialized with text embeddings. 👥 Authors: @ roseannelexie , @ Huage001 , Zigeng Chen, Jingwen Ye, and Xinchao Wang 📅 Conference: ICCV, 19 – 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA 🇺🇸 📄 Paper: Heavy Labels Out!

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts (2307.03172) I spotted the same problem in coding tasks, and documented in my book ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/9999331130 ). Why did this problem become hot again? This is because many of us thought the problem has been solved by long context models, which is not true. Here we were misled by benchmarks. Most long-context benchmarks build around the QA scenario, i.e. "finding needle in haystack". But in agentic scenarios, the model needs to find EVERYTHING in the haystack, and just can't afford enough attention for this challenge.
