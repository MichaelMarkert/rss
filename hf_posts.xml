It continues proving its effectiveness, especially in top-performing reasoning models. However, there are other similar methods, that expand CoT and can be used for different purposes. Here are 9 of them: 1. Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) -&gt; Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search (2502.02508) Helps model decide when to keep thinking, double-check their work, or try a different approach, using special guiding tokens. 2. Chain of Draft (CoD) -&gt; Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less (2502.18600) It helps model generate short but meaningful reasoning steps, cutting costs and making processing faster 3. Chain-of-Agents -&gt; Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks (2406.02818) Uses multi-agent...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 09:24:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/433849056207490</guid></item><item><title>Introducing a new architecture, MedIT One ‚Äì a single-token transformer with LSTM-like recurrence.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mkurman/255930071052172</link><description>Introducing a new architecture, MedIT One ‚Äì a single-token transformer with LSTM-like recurrence.

I just came across a groundbreaking new tool called KGGen that's solving a major challenge in the AI world - the scarcity of high-quality knowledge graph data. KGGen is an open-source Python package that leverages language models to extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from plain text. What makes it special is its innovative approach to clustering related entities, which significantly reduces sparsity in the extracted KGs. The technical approach is fascinating: 1. KGGen uses a multi-stage process involving an LLM (GPT-4o in their implementation) to extract entities and relations from source text 2. It aggregates graphs across sources to reduce redundancy 3. Most importantly, it applies iterative LM-based clustering to refine the raw graph The clustering stage is particularly innovative - it identifies which nodes and edges refer to the same underlying entities or concepts. This normalizes variations in tense, plurality,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 09:24:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/815565847250252</guid></item><item><title>Squeezing out tensor bits?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/832567461491467</link><description>Squeezing out tensor bits? I have been tinkering with quantization and pruning to reduce model sizes. So far, I've had modest success in producing, on average, 8% smaller versions with negligible loss of quality, and I think further reductions in the 10-15% range are realistic, but I've come across a behaviour I wasn't expecting! Part of the process I'm following consists of quantizing the embedding and output layers aggressively. Since the embedding layer is more about lookup than complex computation, the vectors representing the relative distances between embeddings are usually preserved well enough making this layer fairly robust to quantization. So far, so good. The output layer, on the other hand, maps the final hidden state to the vocabulary logits and therefore, small changes in these logits could lead to a different probability distribution over the vocabulary, resulting in incorrect word predictions, or so I thought. Surprisingly, I'm finding that even at Q2_K the loss of...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 09:24:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/832567461491467</guid></item><item><title>Comparing reconstruction quality of various VAEs with an interactive demo</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/rizavelioglu/517500066145145</link><description>Comparing reconstruction quality of various VAEs with an interactive demo rizavelioglu/vae-comparison See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 09:24:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/rizavelioglu/517500066145145</guid></item><item><title>Dear HF Community!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/lingvanex-mt/205421793754165</link><description>Dear HF Community!

Open WebUI Function: https://openwebui.com/f/quaz93/imagine_phi This Phi-4 model is part of a test project that I called Micro-Dose. My goal was to use a small dataset to activate reasoning and other cognitive processes without relying on a large dataset. I found that this was possible with a tiny dataset of just 90 rows, specifically designed as math problems. In the initial iterations, the dataset only activated reasoning when a math-related question was asked. I then made a few changes to the dataset‚Äôs structure, including the order of information and the naming of tags. You can see the sample results in the pictures. Not really anything special, just thought I'd share.
