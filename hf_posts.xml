The final project uses the GAIA dataset - your agent has to solve tasks like analyzing Excel files, processing audio recordings, answering questions about YouTube videos, and diving into research papers. This isn't toy examples, it's the messy, multimodal stuff agents need to handle in practice. Whether you’re just getting started with agents or want to go deeper with tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and SmolAgents, this course has tons of useful stuff. A few key insights: - Code agents are incredibly versatile once you get the architecture right - The sweet spot is finding the right balance of guidance vs autonomy for each use case - Once the logic clicks, the possibilities really are endless - it's like letting LLMs break free from the chatbox The course is free and the certification deadline is July 1st, 2025.

Just pick a React, Svelte, or Vue template when you create your space or add app_build_command: npm run build in your README's YAML and app_file: build/index.html in your README's YAML block. Or follow this link: https://huggingface.co/new-space?sdk=static Let's build!

It fell short, struggling with style consistency and temporal coherence, trailing behind Runway, Pika, @ tencent , and even @ alibaba-pai . That’s changed. We just wrapped up benchmarking Veo3, and the improvements are substantial. It outperformed every other model by a wide margin across all key metrics. Not just better, dominating across style, coherence, and prompt adherence. It's rare to see such a clear lead in today’s hyper-competitive T2V landscape. Dataset coming soon. Stay tuned.

Advantages are: 1. Improved generalization Intuitively, this is because your agent can encounter more "surprising" results by interacting with its environment : for example, a web research called by the LLM teacher in agent mode can bring results that the LLM teacher would not have generated in CoT. 2. Reduce hallucinations The trace won't hallucinate tool call outputs! Thank you @ akseljoonas for mentioning this paper!
