Today I'm introducing a truly special project. DreamO Video is an integrated framework that generates customized images based on reference images and transforms them into videos with natural movement. 🎬✨ openfree/DreamO-video 🔍 Key Features Image Reference (IP): Maintain object appearance while applying to new backgrounds and situations ID Preservation: Retain facial features across various environments Style Transfer: Apply unique styles from reference images to other content 🎞️ Video Generation: Create natural 2-second videos from generated images 💡 How to Use Upload Reference Images: One or two images (people, objects, landscapes, etc.) Select Task Type: Choose between IP (Image Preservation), ID (Face Feature Retention), or Style Enter Prompt: Describe your desired result (e.g., "a woman playing guitar on a cloud") Click Generate Image: ✨ Create customized AI images!

I'm thrilled to share a major update to VisionScout, my end-to-end vision system. Beyond robust object detection (YOLOv8) and semantic context (CLIP), VisionScout now features a powerful LLM-based scene narrator (Llama 3.2), improving the clarity, accuracy, and fluidity of scene understanding. This isn’t about replacing the pipeline , it’s about giving it a better voice. ✨ ⭐️ What the LLM Brings Fluent, Natural Descriptions: The LLM transforms structured outputs into human-readable narratives. Smarter Contextual Flow: It weaves lighting, objects, zones, and insights into a unified story. Grounded Expression: Carefully prompt-engineered to stay factual — it enhances, not hallucinates. Helpful Discrepancy Handling: When YOLO and CLIP diverge, the LLM adds clarity through reasoning. VisionScout Still Includes: 🖼️ YOLOv8-based detection (Nano / Medium / XLarge) 📊 Real-time stats &amp; confidence insights 🧠 Scene understanding via...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 05:23:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/683112818630492</guid></item><item><title>The era of local Computer Use AI Agents is here.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/692657412350660</link><description>The era of local Computer Use AI Agents is here. Meet UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit, now running natively on Apple Silicon via MLX. The video is of UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit completing the prompt "draw a line from the red circle to the green circle, then open reddit in a new tab" running entirely on MacBook. The video is just a replay, during actual usage it took between 15s to 50s per turn with 720p screenshots (on avg its ~30s per turn), this was also with many apps open so it had to fight for memory at times.

These models are the first successful sub 1-billion-token finetune to BitNet architecture. We discovered that by adding an aditional input RMSNorm to each linear, you can finetune directly to BitNet with fast convergence to original model performance! We are working on a pull request to use this extra RMS for any model. To test these models now, install this fork of transformers: pip install git+https://github.com /Codys12/ transformers.git Then load the models and test: from transformers import ( AutoModelForCausalLM , AutoTokenizer ) model_id = "codys12/bitnet-r1-qwen-32b" model = AutoModelForCausalLM .from_pretrained( model_id, device_map= "cuda" , ) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer .from_pretrained(model_id, padding_side= "left" ) bitnet-r1-llama-8b and bitnet-r1-llama-32b were trained on ~ 300M and 200M tokens of the open-thoughts/OpenThoughts-114k dataset respectively, and were still significantly improving at the end of...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 05:23:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codys12/705081891087680</guid></item><item><title># 🌟 3D Model to Video: Easy GLB Conversion Tool 🌟</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/766230066345476</link><description># 🌟 3D Model to Video: Easy GLB Conversion Tool 🌟 demo link: ginigen/3D-VIDEO Hello there!

Fully automated, now live on Spotify. I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don’t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you’re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It’s not perfect yet — I’ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it’s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community — submit a PR or send feedback. It’s just a beta of an experimental idea!
