These models are essentially SFT fine-tuned with the data generated by larger models, and the SFT+RL combo does not disappoint. This is verified in the DeepSeek-R1 paper. 2/ both GRPO and PPO algorithms suffer from length bias; they encourage longer responses. This can be tackled by introducing explicit rewards based on the length of the answer. 3/Most reasoning research is focused on code and math. But training models on logic puzzles improves them for mathematical tasks too. This shows the RL reasoning is generalized beyond the specific domain knowledge. Previous research also shows RL can be a great generalizer. 4/The reasoning might not be only induced by RL; it might already be hidden in the base models due to the pre-training and CoT data they were trained on. So while RL does wake up the...</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/296461908562882</guid></item><item><title>Back to LLM integration.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/JLouisBiz/852112495462828</link><description>Back to LLM integration.
