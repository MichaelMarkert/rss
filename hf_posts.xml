And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. 🎯 Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! 🧠 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 17:18:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>📢 Duality's Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Kaggle competition is back!👏</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/887961203876963</link><description>📢 Duality's Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Kaggle competition is back!👏 Sign up here ➡️ ➡️ https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/multi-instance-object-detection-challenge/overview This competition will test users' ability to train a model for multi-instance object detection.

So here is a fork that you can use, with some instructions on how to do this: jbilcke-hf/Wan2GP_you_must_clone_this_space_to_use_it#1 Note : some things like persistent models/storage/custom LoRAs might not be fully working out of the box. If you need those, you might have to dig into the Wan2GP codebase, see how to tweak the storage folder. Happy hacking!

It combines the sharp detection of YOLOv8, the semantic awareness of CLIP, the environmental grounding of Places365, and the expressive fluency of Llama 3.2. Together, they deliver more than bounding boxes, they produce rich narratives about layout, lighting, activities, and contextual cues. 🏞️ For example: - CLIP’s zero-shot capability recognizes cultural landmarks without any task-specific training - Places365 helps anchor the scene into one of 365 categories, refining lighting interpretation and spatial understanding. It also assists in distinguishing indoor vs. outdoor scenes and enables lighting condition classification such as “sunset”, “sunrise”, or “indoor commercial” - Llama 3.2 turns structured analysis into human-readable, context-rich...</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 17:18:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/336678978162593</guid></item><item><title>C/ua Cloud Containers  - Docker for Computer-Use Agents.
