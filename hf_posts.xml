They're added on top of the v4.49.0 release, and can be installed from the following tags: v4.49.0-SmolVLM-2 and v4.49.0-SigLIP-2 . This marks a new beginning for the release process of transformers. For the past five years, we've been doing monthly releases featuring many models (v4.49.0, the latest release, features 9 new architectures). Starting with SmolVLM-2 &amp; SigLIP2, we'll now additionally release tags supporting new models on a stable branch. These models are therefore directly available for use by installing from the tag itself. These tags will continue to be updated with fixes applied to these models. Going forward, continue expecting software releases following semantic versioning: v4.50.0 will have ~10 new architectures compared to v4.49.0, as well as a myriad of new features, improvements and bug fixes. Accompanying these software releases, we'll release tags offering brand new models as fast as...</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lysandre/966361810633890</guid></item><item><title>Trying something new to keep you ahead of the curve: The 5 AI stories of the week - a weekly curation of the most important AI news you need to know.

Six months after joining Hugging Face the Xet team is kicking off the first migrations from LFS to our storage for a number of repositories on the Hub. More on the nitty gritty details behind the migration soon, but here are the big takeaways: 🤖 We've successfully completed the first migrations from LFS -&gt; Xet to test the infrastructure and prepare for a wider release ✅ No action on your part needed - you can work with a Xet-backed repo like any other repo on the Hub (for now - major improvements on their way!) 👀 Keep an eye out for the Xet logo to see if a repo you know is on our infra! See the screenshots below to spot the difference 👇 ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ Blazing uploads and downloads coming soon. W’re gearing up for a full integration with the Hub's Python library that will make building on the Hub faster than ever - special thanks to @ celinah and @ Wauplin for their assistance. 🎉 Want Early Access?

MemoryCode simulates realistic workplace scenarios where a mentee (the LLM) receives coding instructions from a mentor amidst a stream of both relevant and irrelevant information. 💡 But what makes MemoryCode unique?! The combination of the following: ✅ Multi-Session Dialogue Histories: MemoryCode consists of chronological sequences of dialogues between a mentor and a mentee, mirroring real-world interactions between coworkers. ✅ Interspersed Irrelevant Information: Critical instructions are deliberately interspersed with unrelated content, replicating the information overload common in office environments. ✅ Instruction Updates: Coding rules and conventions can be updated multiple times throughout the dialogue history, requiring LLMs to track and apply the most recent information. ✅ Prospective Memory:...</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mmhamdy/257109472269745</guid></item><item><title>Do you want ArcticTraining at</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/stas/738116252437953</link><description>Do you want ArcticTraining at @ SnowflakeDB to add an ability to post-train DeepSeek V3/R1 models with DPO using just a few GPU nodes?

So far and experimenting with adapting language specific Sentiment Analysis model, got a change to reforge and relaese bulk-translate 0.25.2. ⭐️ https://github.com/nicolay-r/bulk-translate/releases/tag/0.25.2 The update has the following major features - Supporting schemas: all the columns to be translated are now could be declared within the same prompt-style format. using json this automatically allows to map them onto output fields - The related updates for shell execution mode: schema parameter is now available alongside with just a prompt usage before. Benefit is that your output is invariant. You can extend and stack various translators with separated shell laucnhes.
