The final project uses the GAIA dataset - your agent has to solve tasks like analyzing Excel files, processing audio recordings, answering questions about YouTube videos, and diving into research papers. This isn't toy examples, it's the messy, multimodal stuff agents need to handle in practice. Whether you’re just getting started with agents or want to go deeper with tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and SmolAgents, this course has tons of useful stuff. A few key insights: - Code agents are incredibly versatile once you get the architecture right - The sweet spot is finding the right balance of guidance vs autonomy for each use case - Once the logic clicks, the possibilities really are endless - it's like letting LLMs break free from the chatbox The course is free and the certification deadline is July 1st, 2025.

It differs from transformers by predicting the representation of a missing or future part of the input, rather than the next token or pixel. This encourages conceptual understanding, not just low-level pattern matching. So JEPA allows teaching AI to reason abstractly. Here are 12 types of JEPA you should know about: 1. I-JEPA -&gt; Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (2301.08243) A non-generative, self-supervised learning framework designed for processing images. It works by masking parts of the images and then trying to predict those masked parts 2. MC-JEPA -&gt; MC-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Self-Supervised Learning of Motion and Content Features (2307.12698) Simultaneously interprets video data - dynamic elements (motion) and static details (content) - using a shared encoder 3.

It fell short, struggling with style consistency and temporal coherence, trailing behind Runway, Pika, @ tencent , and even @ alibaba-pai . That’s changed. We just wrapped up benchmarking Veo3, and the improvements are substantial. It outperformed every other model by a wide margin across all key metrics. Not just better, dominating across style, coherence, and prompt adherence. It's rare to see such a clear lead in today’s hyper-competitive T2V landscape. Dataset coming soon. Stay tuned.

Good news!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/yukiarimo/528629553860992</link><description>Hello everyone! Good news! The long-awaited Yuna Ai V4 Miru model was finally released: yukiarimo/yuna-ai-v4-miru Now, she can see both images and videos! She has internal knowledge of multiple languages, including primary English, Japanese, and Russian, and she has a built-in ability for Quantum Thinking! Note that half of the features might be unstable. That’s why, for the next half-year, we will not be writing a dataset; it will be created on the fly as she lives! Eventually, she will learn the needed skills in the upcoming interactions! This is a unique model—the first vision model of Yuna with almost 12B parameters (closer to the atomic version, but smarter)! Weights are already on the hub, and support with good documentation will come in a week. Have fun! Please feel free to drop a little donation for our team to help us buy more Colab Compute Units, as more models are on their way! https://www.patreon.com/c/YukiArimo Thank you guys!
