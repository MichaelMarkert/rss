We're highlighting a solution-oriented report from researchers Sahana Naganandh, Vaibhav V, and Thenmozhi M at Vellore Institute of Technology that investigates this exact challenge. The direct connection to our mission is clear: the paper showcases the PII43K dataset as a privacy-preserving alternative to high-risk, raw multilingual data The report notes that our dataset, with its structured anonymization, is a "useful option for privacy-centric AI applications." It's always a delight when academic research independently validates our data-first approach to solving real-world privacy problems. This is how we build a safer AI future together. 🔗 Read the full report here to learn more: https://assets.cureusjournals.com/artifacts/upload/technical_report/pdf/3689/20250724-59151-93w9ar.pdf 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:30:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/151930847327570</guid></item><item><title>LTX-2 Camera-Control LoRA demo with dolly-in/out and dolly-left/right is now available on Hugging Face, paired with ltx-2-19b-distilled-lora for fast inference.

(except Feb 2025) ✨ Qwen trajectory: Not a single “hit” model, but an expanding product line. VL/Math/Coder/Reranker/Embedding/Omni/Next/Image ✨ Multimodal trend: Steadily rising share, shifting from generation to editing + tooling. ✨ Reasoning as a main track: more engineered, system-level reasoning. ✨ From foundation to components: growth in infra models (embeddings, rerankers, OCR, speech) signals a move toward deployable stacks. ✨ Ecosystem broadening: more players beyond the top labs.

NVFP4 models are literally 100%+ faster with minimal impact on quality. I have done grid quality comparison to show you the difference on FLUX 2, Z Image Turbo and FLUX 1 of NVFP4 versions. To make CUDA 13 work, I have compiled Flash Attention, Sage Attention &amp; xFormers for both Windows and Linux with all of the CUDA archs to support literally all GPUs starting from GTX 1650 series, RTX 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 series and more. In this full tutorial, I will show you how to upgrade your ComfyUI and thus SwarmUI to use latest CUDA 13 with latest libraries and Torch 2.9.1. Moreover, our compiled libraries such as Sage Attention works with all models on all GPUs without generating black images or videos such as Qwen Image or Wan 2.2 models.

I'm really grateful for the positive response to the Claude Reflect System. In just 4 days, 30 developers have shown interest by starring the project. Thank you so much! What Is Claude Reflect? Correct once, never again. Claude Reflect helps Claude Code remember your corrections and preferences across sessions. Instead of repeating the same feedback, the system learns and applies it automatically. Main Features: 🧠 Learning System - Detects corrections and preferences from conversations - Stores them permanently in skill files - Applies learnings in future sessions 🔒 Safety First - Automatic backups before changes - YAML validation - Git version control ⚡ Two Modes - Manual: Run /reflect when you want - Auto: Reflects automatically at session end How It Works If you correct Claude to use pytest instead of unittest, this preference gets saved. Next time, Claude will remember and use pytest...</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:30:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/535995505101203</guid></item><item><title>New REPL environment in OpenEnv available! ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/454747936446679</link><description>New REPL environment in OpenEnv available! ✨ Used in the Recursive Language Models (RLM) paper by Alex Zhang.
