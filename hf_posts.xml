We run daily CI on AMD MI325 to track the health of the most important model architectures and we’ve just made our internal dashboard public. By making this easily accessible, we hope to spark community contributions and improve support for everyone!

We've developed an agent to automate the environment building and testing of experimental codebases sourced from arXiv. We push these containerized reproductions daily to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/remyxai However, searching for them can be challenging unless you know the specific arXiv ID associated with each paper. We are currently working on implementing a search feature in Remyx, which will make these assets easily discoverable and ready for testing 🔍 Stay tuned!
