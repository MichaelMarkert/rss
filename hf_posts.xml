Super v1.5 is trained with high-quality reasoning synthetic data generated from models like Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek R1. Besides leading accuracy, it also delivers high throughput. Key features: - Leading accuracy on multi-step reasoning, math, coding, and function-calling - Post-trained using RPO, DPO, and RLVR across 26M+ synthetic examples - Fully transparent training data on HF (Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v1) Try Super v1.5 on build.nvidia.com or download from Hugging Face See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 09:27:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/chintankp/680096865746882</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Optimum: The Last v1 Release 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/721004690541036</link><description>🚀 Optimum: The Last v1 Release 🚀 Optimum v1.27 marks the final major release in the v1 series. As we close this chapter, we're laying the groundwork for a more modular and community-driven future: - Optimum v2: A lightweight core package for porting Transformers, Diffusers, or Sentence-Transformers to specialized AI hardware/software/accelerators.. - Optimum‑ONNX: A dedicated package where the ONNX/ONNX Runtime ecosystem lives and evolves, faster-moving and decoupled from the Optimum core. 🎯 Why this matters: - A clearer governance path for ONNX, fostering stronger community collaboration and improved developer experience.. - Enable innovation at a faster pace in a more modular, open-source environment. 💡 What this means: - More transparency, broader participation, and faster development driven by the community and key actors in the ONNX ecosystem (PyTorch, Microsoft, Joshua Lochner 👀, ...) - A cleaner, more maintainable core Optimum, focused on extending HF libraries to special AI...</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 09:27:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/721004690541036</guid></item><item><title>Cohere just dropped</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/770620321222949</link><description>Cohere just dropped CohereLabs/command-a-vision-07-2025 , a 112B (dense!) vision LM &gt; based on SigLIP2 &amp; Command-A &gt; built for enterprise use cases 🔥 &gt; use with Inference Providers or transformers 🤗 read their blog https://huggingface.co/blog/CohereLabs/introducing-command-a-vision-07-2025 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 09:27:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/770620321222949</guid></item><item><title>Qwen team did it again!!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/564352975503737</link><description>Qwen team did it again!!
