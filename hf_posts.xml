It's smarter, faster, and now understands 119 languages instead of just 29. It can do both deep reasoning and quick answers using a single model, depending on what you need. The models range in size from small (0.6B) to huge (235B), with smart ways to save compute. It's trained on 36 trillion tokens and fine-tuned in four steps to boost performance. Qwen3 performs as well as or better than many top models, including some from big companies. It‚Äôs fully open-source under licence.

I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation‚Äîon just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt‚Äìresponse pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn‚Äôt turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands ‚ÄúOh great, another meeting‚Äù exactly as you mean it.

AA-LCR is 100 hard text-based questions that require reasoning across multiple real-world documents that represent ~100k input tokens. Questions are designed so answers cannot be directly found but must be reasoned from multiple information sources, with human testing verifying that each question requires genuine inference rather than retrieval. Key takeaways: ‚û§ Today‚Äôs leading models achieve ~70% accuracy: the top three places go to OpenAI o3 (69%), xAI Grok 4 (68%) and Qwen3 235B 2507 Thinking (67%) ‚û§üëÄ We also already have gpt-oss results! 120B performs close to o4-mini...</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 05:23:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/georgewritescode/981174566402338</guid></item><item><title>I never told GPT-4 about my architecture.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dimentox/356326320568386</link><description>I never told GPT-4 about my architecture.
