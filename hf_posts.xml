I think this is it, folks. o7 The unstarted spaces I can get behind. I would've appreciated a warning email first, but whatever. However, every time I restart the active usage goes up, despite all of my spaces being moved to CPU (free), and being paused.

Nice work, @ OwenArli ! ArliAI/GLM-4.5-Air-Derestricted Ablation on a MoE model is no small thing; I expect preserving norms/magnitudes during intervention better respects routing compared to naive refusal ablation.

ReubenOS is a virtual cloud-based operating system designed specifically to act as a backend for Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It gives Claude a persistent environment to work in! ✨ Key Features * 📱 Flutter IDE: Claude can write Flutter code and I can view/execute the files directly in the ReubenOS dashboard. * 🎵 AI Audio Studio: Integrated with ElevenLabs to generate songs and voiceovers from text prompts within Claude. * 🔒 Secure File System: A passkey-protected file system (private &amp; public folders) to store code, JSON, and documents. * 🧠 Gemini Integration: Access Google's Gemini model directly inside the OS. * 📝 Quiz Engine: Ask Claude to "Create a Python quiz," and it deploys a graded interactive quiz to the web instantly.
