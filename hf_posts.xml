We released the first version of just that: Crowd-Eval Add one line of code to your training loop and you will have a new real human loss curve in your W&amp;B dashboard. Thousands of real humans from around the world rating your model in real time at the cost of a few dollars per checkpoint is a game changer. Check it out here: https://github.com/RapidataAI/crowd-eval First 5 people to put it in their loop get 100'000 human responses for free!

"Integrity Threats in AI: When Data Poisoning Undermines Model Effectiveness" from Duality AI is now on HuggingFace here: https://huggingface.co/blog/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/integrity-threats-in-ai Significant threats to AI model performance aren’t always loud or obvious. Integrity violations—like subtle data poisoning attacks—can quietly erode your model’s reliability, long before anyone notices. These attacks can be surprisingly effective with minimal changes to the dataset. At Duality, our work in high-stakes sectors like defense has driven us to tackle this threat head-on. In our latest blog from Duality's Director of Infrastructure and Security at Duality, David Strout, we unpack how data poisoning works, why it’s so dangerous, and how organizations can secure their AI pipelines with clear provenance, regular performance auditing, and a trusted synthetic data supply chain. Whether you're building AI models for finance, healthcare, manufacturing, or...</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 17:21:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/462704497331407</guid></item><item><title>Ultimate ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI on RunPod Tutorial with Addition RTX 5000 Series GPUs &amp; 1-Click to Setup :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/478306591921253</link><description>Ultimate ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI on RunPod Tutorial with Addition RTX 5000 Series GPUs &amp; 1-Click to Setup : https://youtu.be/R02kPf9Y3_w Tutorial Video : https://youtu.be/R02kPf9Y3_w If you want to use ComfyUI or SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend on RunPod cloud platform, this is the ultimate tutorial that you will find to step by step install ComfyUI and SwarmUI on RunPod and use each one of them.
