With the latest release of smolagents, you can now securely execute Python code in sandboxed Docker or E2B environments. 🦾🔒 Here's why this is a game-changer for agent-based systems: 🧵👇 1️⃣ Security First 🔐 Running AI agents in unrestricted Python environments is risky! With sandboxing, your agents are isolated, preventing unintended file access, network abuse, or system modifications. 2️⃣ Deterministic &amp; Reproducible Runs 📦 By running agents in containerized environments, you ensure that every execution happens in a controlled and predictable setting—no more environment mismatches or dependency issues! 3️⃣ Resource Control &amp; Limits 🚦 Docker and E2B allow you to enforce CPU, memory, and execution time limits, so rogue or inefficient agents don’t spiral out of control. 4️⃣ Safer Code Execution in Production 🏭 Deploy AI agents confidently, knowing that any generated code runs in an ephemeral, isolated environment, protecting your host machine and...</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 09:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/674737128301579</guid></item><item><title>SigLIP2 Image Classification  🧤</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/550891236404805</link><description>SigLIP2 Image Classification 🧤 &gt; https://huggingface.co/blog/prithivMLmods/siglip2-finetune-image-classification See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 09:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/550891236404805</guid></item><item><title>🚀 New smolagents update: Safer Local Python Execution! 🦾🐍</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/159056887588114</link><description>🚀 New smolagents update: Safer Local Python Execution! 🦾🐍 With the latest release, we've added security checks to the local Python interpreter: every evaluation is now analyzed for dangerous builtins, modules, and functions. 🔒 Here's why this matters &amp; what you need to know! 🧵👇 1️⃣ Why is local execution risky? ⚠️ AI agents that run arbitrary Python code can unintentionally (or maliciously) access system files, run unsafe commands, or exfiltrate data. 2️⃣ New Safety Layer in smolagents 🛡️ We now inspect every return value during execution: ✅ Allowed: Safe built-in types (e.g., numbers, strings, lists) ⛔ Blocked: Dangerous functions/modules (e.g., os.system, subprocess, exec, shutil) 3️⃣ Immediate Benefits 💡 - Prevent agents from accessing unsafe builtins - Block unauthorized file or network access - Reduce accidental security vulnerabilities 4️⃣ Security Disclaimer ⚠️ 🚨 Despite these improvements, local Python execution is NEVER 100% safe. 🚨 If you need true isolation, use a remote...</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 09:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/159056887588114</guid></item><item><title>I just released a fully automated evaluation framework for your RAG applications!📈</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/as-cle-bert/983515572081803</link><description>I just released a fully automated evaluation framework for your RAG applications!📈 GitHub 👉 https://github.com/AstraBert/diRAGnosis PyPi 👉 https://pypi.org/project/diragnosis/ It's called 𝐝𝐢𝐑𝐀𝐆𝐧𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐬 and is a lightweight framework that helps you 𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗴𝗻𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀.

No one before ever managed to prove even the most basic trivialities, such as whether the proportion of ‘0’ or ‘1’ exists in the binary expansions of any of these constants, or if it oscillates indefinitely between 0% and 100%. Here I provide an overview of the new framework built to uncover deep results about the digit distribution of Euler’s number e, discuss the latest developments, share a 10x faster version of the code, and feature new potential research areas in LLMs, AI, quantum dynamics, high performance computing, cryptography, dynamical systems, number theory and more, arising from my discovery. Perhaps the most interesting part is testing LLMs and...</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 09:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/711986528939991</guid></item><item><title>New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928</link><description>New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP Source : https://www.patreon.com/posts/123105403 Tutorial video : https://youtu.be/hnAhveNy-8s Please checkout the screenshots See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 09:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928</guid></item></channel></rss>
