For papers that include code, setting up the right environment often means hours of dependency hell and configuration debugging. At Remyx AI, we built an agent that automatically creates and tests Docker images for research papers, then shares them publicly so anyone can reproduce results with a single command. We just submitted PR #908 to integrate this directly into arXiv Labs. If you believe in making reproducible research accessible to everyone, give it a bump!: https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-browse/pull/908 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 09:24:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/494327094243098</guid></item><item><title>IBM just released small swiss army knife for the document models: granite-docling-258M on Hugging Face 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/445414862119862</link><description>IBM just released small swiss army knife for the document models: granite-docling-258M on Hugging Face 🔥 &gt; not only a document converter but also can do document question answering, understand multiple languages 🤯 &gt; best part: released with Apache 2.0 license 👏 use it with your commercial projects! &gt; it supports transformers, vLLM and MLX from the get-go! 🤗 &gt; built on SigLIP2 &amp; granite-165M model: ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M demo: ibm-granite/granite-docling-258m-demo 💗 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 09:24:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/445414862119862</guid></item><item><title>I'm a Hugging Face Fellow now, guys!🤗❤️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/245628043869780</link><description>I'm a Hugging Face Fellow now, guys!🤗❤️ With the same passion, trust, and momentum to contribute to the community, I’m excited to do some amazing things to wrap up Q3 and Q4 of 2025. And importantly, I’ve been lucky enough to receive some knowledge and guidance from @ merve to build open-source demos and stuff. Thank you for the belief. Thank you — much love.

Fun fact: v4.0.0-rc-1 came out on Nov 19, 2020, nearly five years ago!
