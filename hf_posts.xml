Hoping it'll work for ALL tools if lmstudio gets an update or something, not just llama.cpp, but very happy to see it works flawlessly in llama.cpp...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 05:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/460622149989234</guid></item><item><title>Release picks of the past week is here!

I wanted to share: 1. ⚡ Tokens/sec performance across several SLLMs 2. 🤖 Observations on hardware utilization (where the workload actually runs) 3. 📏 Trade-offs between model size, latency, and feasibility for mobile apps There are reports for below models - QWEN3 0.6B - NVIDIA/Nemotron QWEN 1.5B - SimpleScaling S1 - TinyLlama - Unsloth tuned Llama 3.2 1B - Naver HyperClova 0.5B 📜Comparable Benchmark reports (no cloud, all on-device): I’d really value your thoughts on: - Creative ideas to further optimize inference under these hardware constraints - Other compact LLMs worth testing on-device - Experiences you’ve had trying to deploy LLMs at the edge If there’s interest, I’m happy to share more details on the test setup, hardware specs, or the tooling we used for these comparisons. Thanks for taking a look, and you can build your own...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 05:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</guid></item><item><title>10 Techniques for Boosting LLM Reasoning in 2025</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918</link><description>10 Techniques for Boosting LLM Reasoning in 2025 Everyone’s chasing top reasoning, but sometimes it's still the bottleneck for many real-world tasks. This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -&gt; CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -&gt; Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns. Helps in plug-and-play tool use without training new...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 05:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Try Dhanishtha 2.0 – The Intermediate Thinking Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</link><description>🚀 Try Dhanishtha 2.0 – The Intermediate Thinking Model Meet Dhanishtha 2.0, the world's first LLM designed to _think like a philosopher, respond like a poet, and reflect like a human_ — all in real time. Unlike traditional models that follow a single-pass think → answer pattern, Dhanishtha can think, rethink, self-evaluate, and refine mid-response using multi-phase cognitive structures like &lt;think&gt; and &lt;ser&gt; blocks. ⚡️ Highlights: - Token-Efficient — Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 on questions - Emotionally Aware Reasoning — Thinks and reflects in real-time, no fluff --- 💻 Try It Now with the SDK from HelpingAI import HAI # pip install HelpingAI ==1.1.1 from rich import print hai = HAI( api_key = "hl-***********************" ) response = hai.chat.completions.create( model = "Dhanishtha-2.0-preview" , messages=[{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "What is the value of ∫0∞𝑥3/𝑥−1𝑑𝑥 ?" }], stream = True , hide_think = False # Hide or show models thinking ) for chunk in...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 05:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</guid></item><item><title>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/610118153924016</link><description>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th!
