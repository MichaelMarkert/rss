TL;DR: With MCP (Model Context Protocol), you can expose tools like web search or image generation and connect them directly to LLMs. It’s simple — and surprisingly powerful. pip install "huggingface_hub[mcp]&gt;=0.32.0" We wrote a blog post where we show how to run Tiny Agents, and dive deeper into how they work and how to build your own. 👉 https://huggingface.co/blog/python-tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/celinah/946156020996069</guid></item><item><title>tis the year of any-to-any/omni models 🤠</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/870882250701193</link><description>tis the year of any-to-any/omni models 🤠 ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT 7B native multimodal model that understands and generates both image + text it outperforms leading VLMs like Qwen 2.5-VL 👏 and has Apache 2.0 license 😱 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/870882250701193</guid></item><item><title>🌾 NH Prediction: AI System for Korean Agricultural Price Forecasting 🌾</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/102455854917725</link><description>🌾 NH Prediction: AI System for Korean Agricultural Price Forecasting 🌾 📊 Project Introduction Price volatility in agricultural markets has significant impacts from producers to consumers!
