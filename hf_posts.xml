They're added on top of the v4.49.0 release, and can be installed from the following tags: v4.49.0-SmolVLM-2 and v4.49.0-SigLIP-2 . This marks a new beginning for the release process of transformers. For the past five years, we've been doing monthly releases featuring many models (v4.49.0, the latest release, features 9 new architectures). Starting with SmolVLM-2 &amp; SigLIP2, we'll now additionally release tags supporting new models on a stable branch. These models are therefore directly available for use by installing from the tag itself. These tags will continue to be updated with fixes applied to these models. Going forward, continue expecting software releases following semantic versioning: v4.50.0 will have ~10 new architectures compared to v4.49.0, as well as a myriad of new features, improvements and bug fixes. Accompanying these software releases, we'll release tags offering brand new models as fast as...</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:18:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lysandre/966361810633890</guid></item><item><title>Time flies!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/911431940353906</link><description>Time flies! Six months after joining Hugging Face the Xet team is kicking off the first migrations from LFS to our storage for a number of repositories on the Hub. More on the nitty gritty details behind the migration soon, but here are the big takeaways: 🤖 We've successfully completed the first migrations from LFS -&gt; Xet to test the infrastructure and prepare for a wider release ✅ No action on your part needed - you can work with a Xet-backed repo like any other repo on the Hub (for now - major improvements on their way!) 👀 Keep an eye out for the Xet logo to see if a repo you know is on our infra! See the screenshots below to spot the difference 👇 ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ Blazing uploads and downloads coming soon. W’re gearing up for a full integration with the Hub's Python library that will make building on the Hub faster than ever - special thanks to @ celinah and @ Wauplin for their assistance. 🎉 Want Early Access?
