A month ago there were 5,500 users/orgs on Xet with 150K repos and 4PB. Today? ü§ó 700,000 users/orgs üìà 350,000 repos üöÄ 15PB Meanwhile, our migrations have pushed throughput to numbers that are bonkers. In June, we hit upload speeds of 577Gb/s (crossing 500Gb/s for the first time). These are hard numbers to put into context, but let's try: The latest run of the Common Crawl from commoncrawl was 471 TB. We now have ~32 crawls stored in Xet. At peak upload speed we could move the latest crawl into Xet in about two hours. We're moving to a new phase in the process, so stay tuned. This shift in gears means it's also time to roll up our sleeves and look at all the bytes we have and the value we're adding to the community. I already have some homework from @ RichardErkhov to look at the dedupe across their uploads, and I'll be doing...</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 05:23:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/866221600890917</guid></item><item><title>Hunyuan-A13B üî• New MoE LLM by TencentHunyuan</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/115721386328243</link><description>Hunyuan-A13B üî• New MoE LLM by TencentHunyuan tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct ‚ú®80B total / 13B active params ‚ú®256K context window ‚ú®Dual-mode reasoning: fast &amp; slow thinking ‚ú®Efficient inference (GQA + quantization) See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 05:23:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/115721386328243</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</link><description>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model Dhanishtha 2.0 is the world's first LLM designed to think between the responses. Unlike other Reasoning LLMs, which think just once. Dhanishtha can think, rethink, self-evaluate, and refine in between responses using multiple &lt;think&gt; blocks. This technique makes it Hinghlt Token efficient it Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 --- You can try our model from: https://helpingai.co/chat Also, we're gonna Open-Source Dhanistha on July 1st. --- For Devs: üîë Get your API key at https://helpingai.co/dashboard from HelpingAI import HAI # pip install HelpingAI ==1.1.1 from rich import print hai = HAI( api_key = "hl-***********************" ) response = hai.chat.completions.create( model = "Dhanishtha-2.0-preview" , messages=[{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "What is the value of ‚à´0‚àûùë•3/ùë•‚àí1ùëëùë• ?" }], stream = True , hide_think = False # Hide or show models thinking ) for chunk in response: print...</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 05:23:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</guid></item><item><title>SnowflakeCore-G1 development update: We're building a 24-layer transformer with 32K context and 1024 embedding dimensions - pretty ambitious!

This model runs entirely on a mobile device, without cloud, and without any manual optimization. It was built using ZETIC.MLange, and the best part? ‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs totally automated, free to use, and anyone can do it. You don‚Äôt need to write deployment code, tweak backends, or touch device-specific SDKs. Just upload your model ‚Äî and ZETIC.MLange handles the rest. üß† About the Model - Model: Polaris-4B-Preview - Size: ~4B parameters - Ranking: Top 3 on Hugging Face LLM Leaderboard (&lt;6B) - Tokenizer: Token-incremental inference supported - Modifications: None ‚Äî stock weights, just optimized for mobile ‚öôÔ∏è What ZETIC.MLange Does ZETIC.MLange is a fully automated deployment framework for On-Device AI, built for AI engineers who want to focus on models ‚Äî...</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 05:23:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/894951796717498</guid></item><item><title>Three big AI copyright updates this week alone.

In case you haven't come across it, you can get started with Kontext using ü§ó diffusers. See the official [model]( black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev ) and [docs]( https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/flux#flux ).
