The platform already has a ton of great integrations that let you interact with your external apps directly with tools, but I wanted to add the ability to do stuff in Slack as well. 💪 So I took the base Anthropic Slack MCP server, added a whole bunch of new tools, and generalized it as an HTTP-based SSE-server and deployed it in like 2 minutes with Railway so that Strawberry could make use of it (as can Claude or any other MCP client). Now, you can Chat with your Strawberry Companion (or Claude, or whatever) and do things like: ➡️ Get caught up across all of your Slack channels after a long weekend or noisy incident without having to read 20 threads in 10 different channels ➡️ Create, read, and edit Canvases, Messages, and Channels ➡️ Take any resources or content that you're using in your Chat and inject it directly into Slack without copy / paste 😎 I'm...</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:36:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/672558817086708</guid></item><item><title>Demo for Molmo2 on Hugging Face is live now, including Single/Multi-Image VQA, Visual Pointing/Grounding, Video VQA, and Video Point Tracking.
