I experimented with different recipes and improved the abliteration technique I wrote about last year. It's still experimental but the refusal rate is super low in my tests.

In our recent article, we discussed Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in detail and now it's time to summarize other existing types of attention. Here is a list of 15 types of attention mechanisms used in AI models: 1. Soft attention (Deterministic attention) -&gt; Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (1409.0473) Assigns a continuous weight distribution over all parts of the input. It produces a weighted sum of the input using attention weights that sum to 1. 2. Hard attention (Stochastic attention) -&gt; Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (1508.04025) Makes a discrete selection of some part of the input to focus on at each step, rather than attending to everything. 3. Self-attention -&gt; Attention Is All You Need (1706.03762) Each element in the sequence "looks" at other elements and...</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 05:20:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/624548696865407</guid></item><item><title>‚úÇÔ∏è AutoAbliteration</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/714992455492422</link><description>‚úÇÔ∏è AutoAbliteration I made a Colab notebook to automatically abliterate models.

Despite the costs, the performance makes it a valuable investment, especially in critical applications where translation quality is paramount. Now we can say that Europe is more than imposing regulations. Our dataset, based on these comparisons, is now available on Hugging Face. This might be useful for anyone working on AI translation or language model evaluation.

It uses a regular expression (regex) pattern to match and replace emojis with an empty string, effectively removing them from the text. The pattern includes a range of Unicode characters that correspond to various types of emojis, such as emoticons, symbols, and flags. By using this program, you can clean up text data by removing any emojis that may be present, which can be useful for text processing, analysis, or other applications where emojis are not desired. üíª</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/aifeifei798/845431141575759</link><description>üòä This program is designed to remove emojis from a given text.

We aim to analyze both open-source and closed-source LLMs to understand the political positions and biases expressed in their outputs. Moreover we provide a set of recipes to enforce political positions into the models by creating ad hoc curated datasets and by applying fine tuning techniques. By releasing our work in the open, we hope to foster contributions: https://github.com/mii-llm/propaganda This framework offers opportunities for expansion in various directions and could become the standard reference for evaluating LLMs on political topics, particularly those that influence public opinion.
