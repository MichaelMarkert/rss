Given omni-modal (i.e., textual, visual and speech) inputs, EMOVA can generate both textual and speech responses with vivid emotional controls by utilizing the speech decoder and a style controller. ‚ú® EMOVA Highlights ‚úÖ State-of-the-art omni-modality: EMOVA achieves SoTA comparable results on both vision-language and speech benchmarks simultaneously. ‚úÖ Device adaptation: our codebase supports training/inference on both NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., A800 &amp; H20) and Ascend NPUs (e.g., 910B3)! ‚úÖ Modular design: we integrate multiple implementations of vision encoder, vision projector, and language model. üî• You are all welcome to try and star! - Project page: https://emova-ollm.github.io/ - Github: https://github.com/emova-...</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:19:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/KaiChen1998/260621109030490</guid></item><item><title>to the nvidia employee that won't respond to my emails: hear me now.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nroggendorff/181073331446889</link><description>to the nvidia employee that won't respond to my emails: hear me now. you have made a semi-powerful to irrelevant enemy. you have been warned See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:19:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/nroggendorff/181073331446889</guid></item><item><title>Hello community,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hanzla/186651630886849</link><description>Hello community, I want to share my work of creating a reasoning mamba model I used GRPO over Falcon3 Mamba Instruct to make this model.

My personal favorite is Method #4: Using Hugging Face Datasets for Langfuse Dataset Experiments. This lets you benchmark your LLM app or AI agent with a dataset hosted on Hugging Face. In this example, I chose the GSM8K dataset ( openai/gsm8k ) to test the mathematical reasoning capabilities of my smolagent :) Link to the Article here on HF: https://huggingface.co/blog/MJannik/hugging-face-and-langfuse See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:19:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MJannik/453920098995289</guid></item><item><title>Still speed running Gemma 3 to think.

Today I focused on setting up gpu poor hardware to run GRPO. This is a plain TRL and PEFT notebook which works on mac silicone or colab T4. This uses the 1b variant of Gemma 3 and a reasoning version of GSM8K dataset. üßë‚Äçüç≥ There‚Äôs more still in the oven like releasing models, an Unsloth version, and deeper tutorials, but hopefully this should bootstrap your projects.
