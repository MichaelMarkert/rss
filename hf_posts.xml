Currently, ICEdit app ( RiverZ/ICEdit ) has soared to the second place on the weekly trend list of Hugging Face Space, just trailing behind Qwen3. What's more, it also holds the second position on the overall space trend list. This achievement wouldn't have been possible without your incredible support and love. A huge thank you to each and every one of you❤! 🎉 The ICEdit community has been incredibly active, and we've seen a plethora of amazing ComfyUI workflows being shared. For instance, with the help of ComfyUI - nunchaku, you can run ICEdit locally with just 4GB of VRAM. This makes it much more accessible for those with limited hardware resources. 🎇 If you're interested in the detailed information, please head over to our repository. We highly encourage you to give these workflows a try and explore the creative possibilities that ICEdit offers.

Workflows are through predefined code paths, ensuring that each step is executed in a deterministic manner. Agents are like smart assistants that can think on their own. They understand situations, make decisions, and act, whatever the task is new or unpredictable. Think of the Agent as a chef who can make a meal based on what they have. Workflows are like a recipe with fixed steps. They’re a series of tasks done in order, like following a checklist for approving a loan. They’re great for tasks that don’t change much.
