With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -&gt; https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -&gt; https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3.

As of version [5740]( https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b5740 ), llama-quantize now supports layer pruning via the --prune-layers flag! Findings so far are that removing one or two layers has a relatively moderate impact on quality. PPL and KLD suffer quite a lot, as expected considering that pruning changes the logits distribution, but the drop in inference quality, as reflected by tests' scores, is less pronounced. For example, using the Q4_K_M variants as a benchmark, the average drop between eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-GGUF is &lt; 3% (60.03 vs 61.65). Similar behaviour for eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF , albeit with a bit higher impact at ~5.5% (54.19 vs 57.36). These results seem to confirm Xin Men's et al ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You Expect (2403.03853) Another interesting side-effect, at least with Qwen3-30B-A3B, is...</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:28:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/163350286978506</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Just published: "OpenEvolve: Open-Source Evolutionary Code Optimization with Real-World GPU Kernel Discovery"</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/512779846806813</link><description>🚀 Just published: "OpenEvolve: Open-Source Evolutionary Code Optimization with Real-World GPU Kernel Discovery" We built the first open-source implementation of Google's AlphaEvolve system and used it to automatically discover GPU kernel optimizations that outperform human engineers! Key results: - 21.8% average decode speed improvement on Apple Silicon - 36.7% improvement on long-context transformer attention - Discovered novel vectorization patterns and 2-pass softmax algorithm The system evolved a Metal kernel for Qwen3's Grouped Query Attention from a basic 3-pass implementation into something with sophisticated Apple Silicon optimizations that would take experts months to discover manually. The evolved kernel automatically found the optimal vec&lt;T,8&gt; operations for 128-dim attention heads and fused softmax computation with value accumulation. Really excited about the potential here - imagine evolutionary algorithms automatically discovering optimizations across all our AI...</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:28:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/512779846806813</guid></item><item><title>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 100+ ⭐️ now!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/653320741659718</link><description>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 100+ ⭐️ now!
