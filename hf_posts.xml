This marks the beginning of our journey to become the standard for testing text-to-image and generative models. Our expertise in large-scale human annotations allows researchers to refine their models with accurate, real-world feedback. As we continue to establish ourselves as a key player in model evaluation, we’re here to support researchers with high-quality annotations at scale. Reach out to info@rapidata.ai to see how we can help.

Today, Gradio is used by &gt;1 million developers each month to build and share AI web apps. This includes some of the most popular open-source projects of all time, like Automatic1111, Fooocus, Oobabooga’s Text WebUI, Dall-E Mini, and LLaMA-Factory. How did we get here? How did Gradio keep growing in the very crowded field of open-source Python libraries? I get this question a lot from folks who are building their own open-source libraries. This post distills some of the lessons that I have learned over the past few years: 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level abstractions 2. Embed virality directly into your library 3. Focus on a (growing) niche 4. Your only roadmap should be rapid iteration 5. Maximize ways users can consume your library's outputs 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level...</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 13:30:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/192598522318521</guid></item><item><title>To Meta AI Research: I would like to fold</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/182254197987426</link><description>To Meta AI Research: I would like to fold ylacombe/expresso into the training mix of an Apache TTS model series. Can you relax the Expresso dataset license to CC-BY or more permissive? Barring that, can I have an individual exception to train on the materials and distribute trained Apache models, without direct redistribution of the original files? Thanks!

This tool auto-generates custom benchmarks on your docs to test which models are the best. Most benchmarks test general capabilities, but what matters is how models handle your data and tasks. YourBench helps answer critical questions like: - Do you really need a hundreds-of-billions-parameter model sledgehammer to crack a nut? - Could a smaller, fine-tuned model work better? - How well do different models understand your domain? Some cool features: 📚 Generates custom benchmarks from your own documents (PDFs, Word, HTML) 🎯 Tests models on real tasks, not just general capabilities 🔄 Supports multiple models for different pipeline stages 🧠 Generate both single-hop and multi-hop questions 🔍 Evaluate top models and deploy leaderboards instantly 💰 Full cost analysis to optimize for your budget 🛠️ Fully configurable via a single YAML file 26 SOTA models tested for question generation.
