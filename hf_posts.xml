I have done over 64 different unique Wan 2.2 trainings to prepare the very best working training configurations for you. The configurations are fully working locally with as low as 6 GB GPUs. So you will be able to train your awesome Wan 2.2 image or video generation LoRAs on your Windows computer with easiness. Moreover, I have shown how to train on cloud platforms RunPod and Massed Compute so even if you have no GPU or you want faster training, you can train on cloud for very cheap prices fully privately.

Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:35:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314</guid></item><item><title>arXiv CS endorsement</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/telcom/422373414213997</link><description>arXiv CS endorsement It's Javad, my Google Scholar Profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bja6GwoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en I would like to share my articles with you on Hugging Face, I'm asking for endorsement* in Computer Science arxiv.org.

That friction slows teams down especially when people use different setups. At Voiden, we believe your API artifacts should work anywhere your team does. Our files open seamlessly in VS Code, GitHub, custom Electron clients, and more, without being locked into a specific workspace or tool. Key benefits: -Portability across editors, repos, platforms, and team setups -No proprietary workspace: the repo is the workspace -Easy integration with CI pipelines, linters, and future tools -Future-proof your API workflows with open and flexible artifacts Voiden empowers devs and teams collaborate and stay agile as tools and platforms evolve.

You need a smart sanitizer. A new system called Prϵϵmpt shows how. The first, critical step in their solution is a high-performance Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to find the sensitive data. We're proud to see that these researchers, Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, and Mihir Bellare from the University of Michigan, University of Toronto, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California, San Diego - Rady School of Management and Langroid Incorporated fine-tuned their NER model on 10 high-risk categories from the AI4Privacy dataset. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helps provide the foundation for the critical detection engine, which in turn enables the community to build and test better solutions like Prϵϵmpt's innovative use of encryption and Differential Privacy. 🔗 Check out their paper for a deep dive into a formally private,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:35:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/649372647638290</guid></item><item><title>You can now run GLM-4.7, the new 355B parameter SOTA model on your local device (128GB RAM).✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/419718257011904</link><description>You can now run GLM-4.7, the new 355B parameter SOTA model on your local device (128GB RAM).✨ The model achieves SOTA performance on coding, agentic and chat benchmarks.
