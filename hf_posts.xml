Repo: raincandy-u/Rain-100M Data: HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu , ~3B tokens, English only Tokenizer: custom 16k BPE, context length 4096 Architecture: 12 Transformer layers, hidden size 768, 12 heads, MLP 2048, SiLU, bf16 Rain-100M is a raw base model (not instruction-tuned or safety-aligned), aimed at small-scale research, debugging training pipelines, and CPU/edge experiments. If you run evaluations, finetunes, or visualizations with it, I would be very interested in your results!

What excites me most is its newly launched image editing and multi-image fusion capabilities its semantic understanding is rock-solid this Instruct-following capability basically enables one-sentence end-to-end workflows, delivering a dimensionality-reducing boost in efficiency. Frankly, it nails the pain points of frontline creators: old photo restoration, text modification, even extracting people from multiple images to create group shots. Previously, tweaking the fusion quality took tons of effort, but now the out-of-the-box realism and emotional expression are top-tier zero cheap AI artifacts 👉 Repo: https://hunyuan.tencent.com/chat/HunyuanDefault?from=modelSquare&amp;modelId=Hunyuan-Image-3.0-Instruct technical report：https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23951 See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Benedictat/483321622062325</guid></item><item><title>I'm absolutely stunned by the aesthetics of HunyuanImage-3.0</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kelsend/790764867019535</link><description>I'm absolutely stunned by the aesthetics of HunyuanImage-3.0 The visual effects of this model are simply beyond imagination it’s every bit as good as NanoBanana, no compromise at all. I fine-tuned my micro-scene prompts by adding text overlays and background effects, and its adaptability is truly breathtaking. With just one prompt, you can generate scene posters for any movie or novel. Every detail, from scene design to text style and atmospheric effects, perfectly aligns with the tone of the original material. No forced elements, just seamless, film-grade visual effects that exactly match what I envisioned. 👉 Repo: https://hunyuan.tencent.com/chat/HunyuanDefault?from=modelSquare&amp;modelId=Hunyuan-Image-3.0-Instruct See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kelsend/790764867019535</guid></item><item><title>HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/wangbuer999/572194851679348</link><description>HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped fresh -sourceImage 3.0model!

So I built **SecureCode**: a collection of **8 code models (3B → 20B)** trained to behave more like a security reviewer. What you should expect from SecureCode: - identify likely vuln patterns and explain *why* they’re risky - outline plausible abuse paths (defensive framing) - propose a secure rewrite (drop-in where possible) - include defense-in-depth guidance + regression tests/checks Links: - **Models:** https://huggingface.co/collections/scthornton/securecode - **Dataset:** scthornton/securecode-v2 - **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/html/2512.18542v1 SecureCode v2.0: A Production-Grade Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models (2512.18542) **How to test it (copy/paste prompt):** &gt; You are a...</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/483996346337767</guid></item><item><title>We’ve released two conversational speech datasets from oto on Hugging Face 🤗</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/consome2/284818675921006</link><description>We’ve released two conversational speech datasets from oto on Hugging Face 🤗 Both are based on real, casual, full-duplex conversations, but with slightly different focuses. Dataset 1: Processed / curated subset otoearth/otoSpeech-full-duplex-processed-141h * Full-duplex, spontaneous multi-speaker conversations * Participants filtered for high audio quality * PII removal and audio enhancement applied * Designed for training and benchmarking S2S or dialogue models Dataset 2: Larger raw(er) release otoearth/otoSpeech-full-duplex-280h * Same collection pipeline, with broader coverage * More diversity in speakers, accents, and conversation styles * Useful for analysis, filtering, or custom preprocessing experiments We intentionally split the release to support different research workflows: clean and ready-to-use vs. more exploratory and research-oriented use. The datasets are currently private, but we’re happy to approve access requests — feel free to request access if you’re interested....</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/consome2/284818675921006</guid></item><item><title>🔥 SWE-Pruner can save up to 40% of your Claude Code cost without sacrificing performance.
