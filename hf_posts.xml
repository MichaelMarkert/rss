Moreover, we have updated our FLUX Training APP and presets to the next level. Massive speed up gaings with 0 quality loss and lots of new features.

Anthropic found 98.7% context savings using code execution with MCP, Cloudflare published similar findings. This is my open-source implementation of the same idea. # The Problem Traditional MCP exposes every tool definition directly to the model. With 12 tools, that's thousands of tokens consumed *before the conversation even starts*. Each tool call also passes intermediate results through the context window — a 10,000-row spreadsheet? That's all going into context just to sum a column. # The Solution: One Tool to Rule Them All Agent_Terminal wraps all 12 tools ( Web_Search , Web_Fetch , File_System , Generate_Image , Generate_Speech , Generate_Video , Deep_Research , Memory_Manager , Obsidian_Vault , Shell_Command , Code_Interpreter ) into a single Python code execution gateway. Instead of the model making individual tool calls, it writes...</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:20:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Nymbo/982136402285178</guid></item><item><title>AetherMind_SRL: How I beat 7B models on MMLU with 184M params and a $300 GPU</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/506428935925502</link><description>AetherMind_SRL: How I beat 7B models on MMLU with 184M params and a $300 GPU I’m Sameer, a solo researcher from Iraq working on a single RTX 3050 8GB laptop.Today I’m releasing AetherMind_SRL – a 184M-parameter NLI model that was trained only on tasks (SNLI, MNLI, ANLI, and a small clinical Alzheimer’s dataset). It was never fine-tuned or even shown a single MMLU question during training.Yet here are the zero-shot MMLU (57 subjects) results:Model MMLU Zero-Shot Training Data AetherMind_SRL (me) 184M 36.05 % Only NLI (SNLI/MNLI/ANLI + ADNI) DeBERTa-v3-base 278M ~30.8 % General pre-training BERT-large 340M 27–30 % General pre-training LLaMA-1 7B 7B 34–35 % Massive text corpus LLaMA-2 7B 7B ~45 % Bigger + better data Yes – my 184M model beats every classic 300–400M model and the original 7-billion-parameter LLaMA-1, all while running at 300+ samples/sec on a $300 laptop GPU.How did this happen?I built a standardized self-improvement loop called AetherMind Self-Reflective Learning (SRL)...</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:20:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/506428935925502</guid></item><item><title>Why I think local, open-source models will eventually win.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/941146046599374</link><description>Why I think local, open-source models will eventually win. The most useful AI applications are moving toward multi-turn agentic behavior: systems that take hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to complete a task, e.g. Claude Code, computer-control agents that click, type, and test repeatedly. In these cases, the power of the model is not how smart it is per token, but in how quickly it can interact with its environment and tools across many steps. In that regime, model quality becomes secondary to latency. An open-source model that can call tools quickly, check that the right thing was clicked, or verify that a code change actually passes tests can easily outperform a slightly “smarter” closed model that has to make remote API calls for every move. Eventually, the balance tips: it becomes impractical for an agent to rely on remote inference for every micro-action. Just as no one would tolerate a keyboard that required a network request per keystroke, users won’t accept...</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:20:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/941146046599374</guid></item><item><title>4月？ごろに参加したCerebrasのハッカソンから何故かHuggingfaceのproプランが続いてるんですよね...</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Holy-fox/916850799845292</link><description>4月？ごろに参加したCerebrasのハッカソンから何故かHuggingfaceのproプランが続いてるんですよね... 多分ハッカソン期間だけのはずなんだけど、外れないのよね。 まあ、クレカとかは登録してないから大丈夫だとは思うけど See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:20:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Holy-fox/916850799845292</guid></item><item><title>Accidentally made a totally blank, non-functioning HF Space while poking “what does this do” buttons without reading anything.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Babsie/682016122905240</link><description>Accidentally made a totally blank, non-functioning HF Space while poking “what does this do” buttons without reading anything.
