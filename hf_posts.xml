That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve curated 13 cool MCP servers to upgrade your workflow: 1. Hugging Face Official MCP Server -&gt; https://github.com/evalstate/hf-mcp-server Provides an access and interaction with Hugging Face models, datasets, and Gradio Spaces for dynamic tool integration and configuration across environments. 2. Browser MCP -&gt; https://browsermcp.io/ An MCP server +Chrome extension. It allows to automate your browser with AI apps like VS Code, Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf. 3. Bright Data MCP -&gt; https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp This one is for working with data in real-time: searching the web, navigating websites, taking action and retrieving data. 4. JSON MCP -&gt; https://github.com/VadimNastoyashchy/json-mcp Interact with JSON files: split, merge, find specific data, and validate content within them. 5.

Think of a simplified, from-scratch version of the Claude Code agent üíª. You can check out the basic framework I've already started here: [github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent]( https://github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent ) üî• To be clear, the goal isn't to create a perfect, commercial-grade tool. This is a for-fun project geared towards research and exploration. The main idea is to build a **flexible and minimal framework** that helps us understand the modules and functionalities of sophisticated agents like Claude Code. It's a playground to explore how we can enable agents to handle more complex tasks effectively. I'm looking for a few people who'd be interested in exploring this together. We could experiment with ideas like adding a to-do list manager to improve planning or finding better ways for the agent to manage its memory like some...</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 13:36:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/620116280773759</guid></item><item><title>Transformers are getting old!
