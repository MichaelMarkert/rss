Here are 7 recent JEPA variants plus 5 iconic ones: 1. LeJEPA → LeJEPA: Provable and Scalable Self-Supervised Learning Without the Heuristics (2511.08544) Explains a full theory for JEPAs, defining the “ideal” JEPA embedding as an isotropic Gaussian, and proposes the SIGReg objective to push JEPA toward this ideal, resulting in practical LeJEPA 2. JEPA-T → JEPA-T: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with Text Fusion for Image Generation (2510.00974) A text-to-image model that tokenizes images and captions with a joint predictive Transformer, enhances fusion with cross-attention and text embeddings before training loss, and generates images by iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text 3.

This tutorial covers how to do LoRA training and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth training on Qwen Image models. It covers both the Qwen Image base model and the Qwen Image Edit Plus 2509 model. This tutorial is the product of 21 days of full R&amp;D, costing over $800 in cloud services to find the best configurations for training. Furthermore, we have developed an amazing, ultra-easy-to-use Gradio app to use the legendary Kohya Musubi Tuner trainer with ease. You will be able to train locally on your Windows computer with GPUs with as little as 6 GB of VRAM for both LoRA and Fine-Tuning.

The latest guide breaks down the essential math to determine if your LLM workload is compute-bound or memory-bound. We apply these principles to a real-world example: Qwen's 32B parameter model on the new NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Edition. In this guide, you will learn how to: Calculate your GPU's operational intensity (Ops:Byte Ratio) Determine your model's arithmetic intensity Identify whether your workload is memory-bound or compute-bound Read the full guide here: https://flozi.net/en/guides/ai/llm-inference-math See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:23:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/flozi00/635605102777732</guid></item><item><title>Implemented a proof of concept sampler in pure PyTorch and transformers.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/grimjim/343972883837810</link><description>Implemented a proof of concept sampler in pure PyTorch and transformers. Max P consists of a dynamic token filter which applies Winsorization to cap the probabilties of top tokens. Specifically, a base probability in the range of [0,1] is used to cap individual token probability; the sampler then redistributes excess proportionally. https://github.com/jim-plus/maxp-sampler-poc Combined with Temperature and Min P, this could represent a more intuitive way of reducing repetition in text generation.
