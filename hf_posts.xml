I don't really want your data, so I'm sorry that I don't think there's a way around that? But that's what I'm gonna do for now, and I'll remove the gate when a fix is up and verified and I have a chance to re-convert and quantize! Hope you don't mind in the mean time :D See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 05:22:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/160920719239523</guid></item><item><title>Agentic AI Era: Analyzing MCP vs MCO üöÄ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/305569626054328</link><description>Agentic AI Era: Analyzing MCP vs MCO üöÄ Hello everyone! With the rapid advancement of AI agent technology, two architectures have come into the spotlight: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and MCO (Model Context Open-json). Today, we‚Äôll introduce the key features and differences of these two approaches. VIDraft/Agentic-AI-CHAT MCP: The Traditional Approach üèõÔ∏è Centralized Function Registry: All functions are hardcoded into the core system. Static Function Definitions &amp; Tight Coupling: New features require changes to the core application code, limiting scalability. Monolithic Design: Complex deployment and version management can cause a single error to affect the whole system. Code Example: '''py FUNCTION_REGISTRY = { "existing_function": existing_function, "new_function": new_function # Adding a new function } ''' MCO: A Revolutionary Approach üÜï JSON-based Function Definitions: Function details are stored in external JSON files, enabling dynamic module loading.

At Hugging Face‚Äîin robotics and across all AI fields‚Äîwe believe in a future where AI and robots are open-source, transparent, and affordable; community-built and safe; hackable and fun. We've had so much mutual understanding and passion working with the Pollen Robotics team over the past year that we decided to join forces! You can already find our open-source humanoid robot platform Reachy 2 on the Pollen website and the Pollen community and people here on the hub at pollen-robotics We're so excited to build and share more open-source robots with the world in the coming months!
