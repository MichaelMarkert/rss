I turned this into a GitHub repo: https://github.com/ArturoNereu/AI-Study-Group If you’re just getting started, I recommend: 📘 Deep Learning – A Visual Approach: https://www.glassner.com/portfolio/deep-learning-a-visual-approach 🎥 Dive into LLMs with Andrej Karpathy: https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=aUTq_qUzyUx36BsT 🧠 The 🤗 Agents course]( https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/ The repo has grown with help from the community (Reddit, Discord, etc.) and I’ll keep updating it.

Fully automated, now live on Spotify. I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don’t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you’re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It’s not perfect yet — I’ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it’s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community — submit a PR or send feedback. It’s just a beta of an experimental idea!

Recent RL paradigms often relied on a set of questions an answers that needs to be manually curated. Researchers from Tsinghua University went like "why though". 🤔 Indeed, why learn from question designed by a human teacher, when the model can start from their base knowledge and learn by experimenting in a code environment, proposing coding tasks themselves and trying to solve them? Thus they created “Absolute Zero Reasoning” (AZR), an approach that removes any need for human curated data. 🎭 𝗗𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀: ‣ Proposer: Generates challenging but solvable coding tasks ‣ Solver: Attempts to solve those self-proposed tasks 🧪 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀: all types are defined as triplets of program, input and output ‣ Deduction: Give model an input and program, it must deduce the output ‣ Abduction: Give model an program and output, it must find the input that gave said output ‣ Induction: Synthesize a...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 09:25:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/402808163323191</guid></item><item><title>🚀 VisionScout Now Speaks More Like Me — Thanks to LLMs!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/683112818630492</link><description>🚀 VisionScout Now Speaks More Like Me — Thanks to LLMs! I'm thrilled to share a major update to VisionScout, my end-to-end vision system. Beyond robust object detection (YOLOv8) and semantic context (CLIP), VisionScout now features a powerful LLM-based scene narrator (Llama 3.2), improving the clarity, accuracy, and fluidity of scene understanding. This isn’t about replacing the pipeline , it’s about giving it a better voice. ✨ ⭐️ What the LLM Brings Fluent, Natural Descriptions: The LLM transforms structured outputs into human-readable narratives. Smarter Contextual Flow: It weaves lighting, objects, zones, and insights into a unified story. Grounded Expression: Carefully prompt-engineered to stay factual — it enhances, not hallucinates. Helpful Discrepancy Handling: When YOLO and CLIP diverge, the LLM adds clarity through reasoning. VisionScout Still Includes: 🖼️ YOLOv8-based detection (Nano / Medium / XLarge) 📊 Real-time stats &amp; confidence insights 🧠 Scene understanding via...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 09:25:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/683112818630492</guid></item><item><title>✨ DreamO Video: From Customized Images to Videos ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/538970335354687</link><description>✨ DreamO Video: From Customized Images to Videos ✨ Hello, AI creators!
