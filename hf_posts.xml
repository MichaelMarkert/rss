Thrilled to share insights from my recent interview with MIT Technology Review about the growing movement toward local LLMs and what it means for AI democratization. Read here: https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/17/1120391/how-to-run-an-llm-on-your-laptop/ ðŸ¤” Why this matters: When we use "free" online AI services, we're often the product. Our conversations become training data, our personal stories get "cooked into" models, and our privacy becomes a commodity. But there's an alternative path forward. ðŸ’¡ The power shift is real: Local LLMs aren't just about privacy; they're about redistributing AI power away from a handful of tech giants. When individuals, organizations, and even entire nations can run their own models, we're democratizing access to AI capabilities. ðŸ¤— At Hugging Face, we're proud to be at the center of this transformation. Our platform hosts the world's largest library of freely...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/921319982169542</guid></item><item><title>Dropping the general-purpose reasoning dataset Poseidon-Reasoning-5M, which supports general thought processes, math, and science â€” featuring a diverse mixture of domains ðŸŒŠ :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/657825800018453</link><description>Dropping the general-purpose reasoning dataset Poseidon-Reasoning-5M, which supports general thought processes, math, and science â€” featuring a diverse mixture of domains ðŸŒŠ : prithivMLmods/Poseidon-Reasoning-5M from datasets import load_dataset dataset = load_dataset( "prithivMLmods/Poseidon-Reasoning-5M" , split = "data" ) The compact version is as follows â€” Poseidon-Reasoning-Mini-300K : prithivMLmods/Poseidon-Reasoning-Mini-300K from datasets import load_dataset dataset = load_dataset( "prithivMLmods/Poseidon-Reasoning-Mini-300K" , split = "train" ) Collection : prithivMLmods/poseidon-reasoning-6879ca98e118b307c781a9ba See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/657825800018453</guid></item><item><title>AudioRAG is becoming real!

Just built a demo with ColQwen-Omni that does semantic search on raw audio, no transcription needed. Drop in a podcast, ask your question, and it finds the exact chunks where it happens. You can also get a written answer. Whatâ€™s exciting: it skips transcription, making it faster and better at capturing emotion, ambient sound, and tone, surfacing results text search would miss. - Demo: fdaudens/colqwen-omni-demo - Blog post from ColQwen team: https://huggingface.co/blog/manu/colqwen-omni-omnimodal-retrieval See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/135737241770101</guid></item><item><title>In our recent push to make more models available on Azure, we recently added SmolLM v3 in the catalog! ðŸš€</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/602957516699349</link><description>In our recent push to make more models available on Azure, we recently added SmolLM v3 in the catalog! ðŸš€ @ juanjucm wrote a really detailed guide on how to deploy on Azure AI ðŸ¤— https://huggingface.co/docs/microsoft-azure/azure-ai/examples/deploy-smollm3 If you want to see other models, please let us know See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/602957516699349</guid></item><item><title>M2-ReasoningðŸ”¥ a unified multimodal model for general (math, logic) and spatial (motion, physics, orientation) reasoning, released by  AntGroup.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/685652769208143</link><description>M2-ReasoningðŸ”¥ a unified multimodal model for general (math, logic) and spatial (motion, physics, orientation) reasoning, released by AntGroup.

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: SkinCancerViT, a multimodal Vision Transformer model for skin lesion analysis ethicalabs/SkinCancerViT I've wrapped it in a Gradio app to make it easy to explore: ethicalabs/SkinCancerViTPredictor This app is a research demonstration that combines dermatoscopic images with patient age and lesion localization to assist in classifying skin lesions. You can either upload your own image and patient data for a prediction, or explore how the model performs on random samples from the marmal88/skin_cancer dataset. I firmly believe that the only final, trustworthy diagnosis comes from medical professionals, and I am actively seeking medical institutions and researchers who might be interested in partnering with me to further explore the usage of this methodology, conducting further training with diverse datasets (ethically sourced and anonymized), performing extensive validation tests, and explore the...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/914919292340851</guid></item><item><title>We just released native support for</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/erikkaum/446865684986007</link><description>We just released native support for @ SGLang and @ vllm-project in Inference Endpoints ðŸ”¥ Inference Endpoints is becoming the central place where you deploy high performance Inference Engines.
