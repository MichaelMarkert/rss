These models achieve 93% average accuracy across enterprise use cases like email routing, fraud detection, document classification, and support ticket categorization. Built on ModernBERT with prototype memory and elastic weight consolidation. Key benefits: 90% cost reduction vs API solutions, 90-120ms local inference, dynamic class addition, and zero vendor lock-in. All models available under adaptive-classifier organization. Install with pip install adaptive-classifier.

In this collection, we’ve gathered the most recent books to give you up-to-date information on key fundamental topics. Hope this helps you master AI and machine learning: 1. Machine Learning Systems by Vijay Janapa Reddi → https://www.mlsysbook.ai/ Provides a framework for building effective ML solutions, covering data engineering, optimization, hardware-aware training, inference acceleration, architecture choice, and other key principles 2. Generative Diffusion Modeling: A Practical Handbook by Zihan Ding, Chi Jin → https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17162 Offers a unified view of diffusion models: probabilistic, score-based, consistency, rectified flow, pre/post-training. It aligns notations with code to close the “paper-to-code” gap. 3. Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges → https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478 Explores unified geometric principles to analyze neural...</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:24:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/253421169111650</guid></item><item><title>𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿𝟮𝗣𝗥𝘀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/749801614139816</link><description>𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿𝟮𝗣𝗥𝘀 Lately, we've been experimenting with recommending arXiv papers based on the context of what we're building in AI. At the same time, we're using an agent to help automate the building and testing of Docker Images. Check out the example here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/remyxai/2507.20613v1/general Next, we're tasking our #ExperimentOps agent to open PRs in a target repo, to evaluate the core concepts from a new research paper in the context of your application and your kpis.

I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation—on just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt–response pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn’t turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands “Oh great, another meeting” exactly as you mean it.
