I recently stumbled upon a medical domain-specific FACTS Grounding leaderboard on Hugging Face, and the approach to evaluating AI accuracy in medical contexts is quite impressive, so I thought I'd share. üìä What is FACTS Grounding? It's originally a benchmark developed by Google DeepMind that measures how well LLMs generate answers based solely on provided documents. What's cool about this medical-focused version is that it's designed to test even small open-source models. üè• Medical Domain Version Features 236 medical examples: Extracted from the original 860 examples Tests small models like Qwen 3 1.7B: Great for resource-constrained environments Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash for evaluation: Simplified to a single judge model üìà The Evaluation Method is Pretty Neat Grounding Score: Are all claims in the response supported by the provided document? Quality Score: Does it properly answer the user's question? Combined Score:...</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 17:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/221417890817416</guid></item><item><title>EARLY SNEAK PREVIEW: get a first look at the Celestia 3 science-reasoning dataset, built with DeepSeek's newest R1-0528 reasoning model!
