Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

So we’ve made 2 notebook for abliterating any model in order to achieve a good model that will actually help you! The notebooks are made using @ mlabonne ‘s abliteration logic and datasets! Feel free to use them and happy training 😊 https://github.com/dralexlup/LLM-Abliteration See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:36:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/zamal/148346638153657</link><description>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️ A powerful, modular toolkit for intelligent video manipulation and scene editing.

Key capabilities: - AI-powered semantic search for models and datasets - Parameter count analysis via safetensors metadata - Trending content discovery - Find similar models/datasets functionality - 11 tools total for enhanced ecosystem navigation The semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching, understanding context and relationships between different models and datasets. Example query: "Find around 10 reasoning Hugging Face datasets published in 2025 focusing on topics other than maths and science. Show a link and a short summary for each dataset."

And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. 🎯 Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! 🧠 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:36:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>Agents &amp; MCP Hackathon Day 8</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/azettl/866417641952211</link><description>Agents &amp; MCP Hackathon Day 8 Today I added arXiv, GitHub, SEC EDGAR to the research agent. I also improved the speech bubbles of the agent so you can see exactly what is going on. As tomorrow is the last day, please try the roundtable and let me know if you miss something and I will try to add it. Also, please like the space if you find my MCP useful.

Ask an expert AI agent team to solve complex problems together 🔥 Consilium brings together multiple agents that debate and use live research (web, arXiv, SEC) to reach a consensus. You set the strategy, they find the answer.
