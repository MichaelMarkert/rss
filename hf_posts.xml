And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. 🎯 Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! 🧠 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 13:29:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>NEW: Real-time conversational AI models can now run 100% locally in your browser! 🤯</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Xenova/927328273503233</link><description>NEW: Real-time conversational AI models can now run 100% locally in your browser! 🤯 🔐 Privacy by design (no data leaves your device) 💰 Completely free... forever 📦 Zero installation required, just visit a website ⚡️ Blazingly-fast WebGPU-accelerated inference Try it out: webml-community/conversational-webgpu For those interested, here's how it works: - Silero VAD for voice activity detection - Whisper for speech recognition - SmolLM2-1.7B for text generation - Kokoro for text to speech Powered by Transformers.js and ONNX Runtime Web! 🤗 I hope you like it!
