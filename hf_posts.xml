I really like their approach: 1) &lt;think&gt;on prompt/context &amp;&amp; what u know &lt;/think&gt; 2) self &lt;search&gt;when u don’t know&lt;/search&gt; (iteratively) with no external tool 3) &lt;information&gt;cite sources to support claim(s)&lt;/information&gt; 4) &lt;answer&gt;final answer&lt;/answer&gt; their rl training was done cost efficiently too, see code: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/SSRL See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 13:33:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/861738398724390</guid></item><item><title>🎨 Open Nano-Banana: Revolution in Ultra-Fast AI Image Editing!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/250380945868372</link><description>🎨 Open Nano-Banana: Revolution in Ultra-Fast AI Image Editing! 🚀 Introduction **Open Nano-Banana** is an innovative image editing tool based on the Qwen-Image-Edit model.

But what does it actually mean when an LLM is “thinking”? Imagine a chess player pausing before their next move not because they don’t know how to play, but because they’re running through possibilities, weighing options, and choosing the best one. LLMs do something similar… except they’re not really thinking like us. Here’s the surprising part :- You might think these reasoning skills come from futuristic architectures or alien neural networks. In reality, most reasoning LLMs still use the same transformer decoder-only architecture as other models The real magic? It’s in how they’re trained and what data they learn from. Can AI actually think, or is it just insanely good at faking it? I broke it down in a simple, 4-minute Medium read. Bet you’ll walk away with at least one “aha!” moment. 🚀 Read here - https://lnkd.in/edZ8Ceyg See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 13:33:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/RakshitAralimatti/207934490136479</guid></item><item><title>✨ HairPick | Preview Your Perfect Hair Transformation in 360° ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/955296677233221</link><description>✨ HairPick | Preview Your Perfect Hair Transformation in 360° ✨ 🎊 Free Trial for Hugging Face Launch!

These taxonomies break down jobs into tasks and skills, but they were built in a world before most work became digital-first, and long before generative AI could create marketing campaigns, voiceovers, or even whole professions in one step. That leaves us with a mismatch: we’re trying to measure the future of work with tools from the past. With @ yjernite we describe why these frameworks are falling increasingly short in the age of generative AI. We argue that instead of discarding taxonomies, we need to adapt them. Imagine taxonomies that: ✨ Capture new AI-native tasks and hybrid human-AI workflows ✨ Evolve dynamically as technology shifts ✨ Give workers a voice in deciding what gets automated and what stays human If we don’t act, we’ll keep measuring the wrong things. If we do, we can design...</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 13:33:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/frimelle/763316628765853</guid></item></channel></rss>
