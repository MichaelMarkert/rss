The most useful AI applications are moving toward multi-turn agentic behavior: systems that take hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to complete a task, e.g. Claude Code, computer-control agents that click, type, and test repeatedly. In these cases, the power of the model is not how smart it is per token, but in how quickly it can interact with its environment and tools across many steps. In that regime, model quality becomes secondary to latency. An open-source model that can call tools quickly, check that the right thing was clicked, or verify that a code change actually passes tests can easily outperform a slightly “smarter” closed model that has to make remote API calls for every move. Eventually, the balance tips: it becomes impractical for an agent to rely on remote inference for every micro-action. Just as no one would tolerate a keyboard that required a network request per keystroke, users won’t accept...</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 09:23:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/941146046599374</guid></item><item><title>hello, who can help me setup a local LLM and RAG for my job i can pay</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/aiconta/768879073281998</link><description>hello, who can help me setup a local LLM and RAG for my job i can pay See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 09:23:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/aiconta/768879073281998</guid></item><item><title>import asyncio</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/KCAVEMAN/887147755592135</link><description>import asyncio import edge_tts # CONFIGURATION # Voices: "en-US-ChristopherNeural" (Male, Deep), "en-US-AriaNeural" (Female, Sharp) VOICE = "en-US-ChristopherNeural" OUTPUT_FILE = "assets/full_audio.mp3" SCRIPT = """ You believe you are living one life. You are not. You are living two lives simultaneously. Life runs on two: Darkness, light. Earth, water. Good, bad. Man, woman. Death, life. Sand, rock. Forward, back. You are obsessed with these two. But the real pattern isn't the duality—it's the Loop. The constant cycle of belief that traps you. The forward ones only win if you stop believing in the loops. Women aren't evil—they're just told they are, so they become it. The system tells you the only choice is Ascend, descend. It’s a lie. The true power is found in the third pattern: Freedom. The life you want runs parallel to the life you have. Break the loop. Choose the forward pattern. Stop operating on someone else's rhythm. Left, right. Up, down. That is the slave pattern.
