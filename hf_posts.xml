I made this whilst prepping the next unit of the reasoning course: In this notebooks I combine together google‚Äôs model with some community tooling - First, I load the model from the Hugging Face hub with transformers‚Äôs latest release for Gemma 3 - I use PEFT and bitsandbytes to get it running on Colab - Then, I took Will Browns processing and reward functions to make reasoning chains from GSM8k - Finally, I used TRL‚Äôs GRPOTrainer to train the model Next step is to bring Unsloth AI in, then ship it in the reasoning course.

Sharing my notes of his Q&amp;A with the press‚Äîcompletely changed how I think about AI‚Äôs future: 1Ô∏è‚É£ The next wave of successful AI companies won‚Äôt be defined by who has the best model but by who builds the most useful real-world solutions. "We all have engines in our cars, but that‚Äôs rarely the only reason we buy one. We expect it to work well, and that‚Äôs enough. LLMs will be the same." 2Ô∏è‚É£ Big players are pivoting: "Closed-source companies‚ÄîOpenAI being the first‚Äîhave largely shifted from LLM announcements to product announcements." 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open source is changing everything: "DeepSeek was open source AI‚Äôs ChatGPT moment.
