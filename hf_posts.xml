Every byte downloaded comes through our infrastructure. Using Xet on Hugging Face is the fastest way to download and iterate on open source models and we've proved it with Llama 4 giving a boost of ~25% across all models. We expect builders on the Hub to see even more improvements, helping power innovation across the community. With the models on our infrastructure, we can peer in and see how well our dedupe performs across the Llama 4 family. On average, we're seeing ~25% dedupe, providing huge savings to the community who iterate on these state-of-the-art models. The attached image shows a few selected models and how they perform on Xet. Thanks to the meta-llama team for launching on Xet!

LLMs are key in this part. - Action: agent's output and tool use. Agentic memory is represented as: - Sensory memory or short-term holding of inputs which is not emphasized much in agents. - Short-term memory which is the LLM context window - Long-term memory which is the external storage such as RAG or knowledge graphs.

And it introduces EXL3 - a new SOTA quantization format! "The conversion process is designed to be simple and efficient and requires only an input model (in HF format) and a target bitrate. By computing Hessians on the fly and thanks to a fused Viterbi kernel, the quantizer can convert a model in a single step, taking a couple of minutes for smaller models, up to a few hours for larger ones (70B+) (on a single RTX 4090 or equivalent GPU.)"
