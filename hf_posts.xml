For all inputs: 1 . Start with &lt;thinking&gt; - Break down problems step - by - step - Consider multiple approaches - Calculate carefully - Identify errors - Evaluate critically - Explore edge cases - Check knowledge accuracy - Cite sources when possible 2 . End with &lt;/thinking&gt; 3 . Then respond clearly based on your thinking. The &lt;thinking&gt; section is invisible to users and helps you produce better answers. For math: show all work and verify For coding: reason through logic and test edge cases For facts: verify information and consider reliability For creative tasks: explore options before deciding For analysis: examine multiple interpretations Example: &lt;thinking&gt; [ Step - by - step analysis] [Multiple perspectives] [Self-critique] [Final conclusion] &lt;/thinking&gt; [Clear, concise response to user] See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:25:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/luigi12345/612317420621834</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/214646053127729</link><description>🚀 Gemma3-R1984-27B: Next Generation Agentic AI Platform Model Path: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B Space: VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B git clone VIDraft/Gemma-3-R1984-27B 💫 A New Frontier in AI Innovation Gemma3-R1984-27B is a powerful agentic AI platform built on Google's Gemma-3-27B model.

When you open source a piece of software, users leave their feedbacks via issues or PRs. You can merge their feedbacks in semi real time, this creates a positive cycle. Then you have a community. LLMs don't have these nice micro steps. There are no hot fixes. Even a minor version bump is an endeavor. I'm quite confident my model is being used by teams somewhere. But until next launch, it's awfully quiet. I don't know the solution. Just a regular lament before weekend. 🤗 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:25:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/823420417019568</guid></item><item><title>ritvik77/ContributionChartHuggingFace</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ritvik77/315133968126281</link><description>ritvik77/ContributionChartHuggingFace It's Ready! One feature Hugging Face could really benefit from is a contribution heatmap — a visual dashboard to track user engagement and contributions across models, datasets, and models over the year, similar to GitHub’s contribution graph. Guess what, Clem Delangue mentioned idea about using HF API reference for it and we made it for use. If you are a Hugging Face user add this Space in your collection and it will give you all stats about your contributions and commits nearly same as GitHub. It's still a prototype and still working on it as a product feature.

We dive deep into the algorithm behind DeepSeek R1 with an advanced and hands-on guide to interpreting GRPO. 🔗 https://huggingface.co/reasoning-course This unit is super useful if you’re tuning models with reinforcement learning. It will help with: - interpreting loss and reward progression during training runs - selecting effective parameters for training - reviewing and defining effective reward functions This unit also works up smoothly toward the existing practical exercises form @ mlabonne and Unsloth. 📣 Shout out to @ ShirinYamani who wrote the unit. Follow for more great content.
