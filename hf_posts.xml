Apologies for the delay, but we’re stoked to finally drop this, even in its alpha stage. Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. **No commercial use yet**: We're still working on Deca 2.5 (Proprietary), and releasing Deca 3 for commercial use right now would impact that. Once Deca 3.5 hits in early '26, we’ll be opening it up with a more permissive license. 2. **Built on existing models**: Deca 3 isn’t a ground-up creation—it’s a huge step forward, building on what’s already out there. 3. **It’s experimental**: As much as we’re hyped about its scale, it’s still in testing. 4. **DynaMoE architecture**: Run a (very) small part of the model with 64GB of RAM/VRAM (when quantized - quants coming soon), or the whole thing with 1TB. It’s that scalable. 5. **Not widely...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ccocks-deca/499605656909204</guid></item><item><title>why did 36 people unfollow me 😭</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/419010322512677</link><description>why did 36 people unfollow me 😭 we are back in the hundreds. if you become my 500th follower and have proof I'll give you 5 dollars worth of openrouter credits as an API key See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/419010322512677</guid></item><item><title>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/826512832075444</link><description>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Tutorial Video : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Wan 2.2, Qwen Image, FLUX, FLUX Krea, all these models are the SOTA open-source models and in this master tutorial I will show you how to use these models in the easiest, most performant, and most accurate way. After doing almost one week of research, I have determined the very best presets and prepared this tutorial. With literally one click you will be able to install, download models, set presets, and use these amazing models. Wan 2.2 is currently the king of video generation models and now it is super fast with lightx2v Wan2.2-Lightning LoRAs. Moreover, Qwen Image is now ultra-fast with the recently released 8-step LoRA with almost no quality loss. Furthermore, I have updated FLUX and FLUX Krea presets to improve image generation...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/826512832075444</guid></item><item><title>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</link><description>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team ByteDance-Seed/seed-oss-68a609f4201e788db05b5dcd ✨ 36B - Base &amp; Instruct ✨ Apache 2.0 ✨ Native 512K long context ✨ Strong reasoning &amp; agentic intelligence ✨ 2 Base versions: with &amp; without synthetic data See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</guid></item><item><title>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</link><description>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure 1/ no more long waits before seeing model support status 2/ ready-to-use CLI and Python snippets 3/ redirection to Azure AI Foundry rather than Azure ML ✋ if you see any bugs or have feedback, open an issue on our repo: https://github.com/huggingface/Microsoft-Azure See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</guid></item><item><title>Stay Ahead of AI Risks - Free Live Session for Tech Leaders</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/428214748329021</link><description>Stay Ahead of AI Risks - Free Live Session for Tech Leaders Exclusive working session about trustworthy AI, for senior tech leaders. Register at https://lu.ma/zrxsvy6c ​AI isn’t slowing down, but poorly planned AI adoption will slow you down. Hallucinations, security risks, bloated compute costs, and “black box” outputs are already tripping up top teams, burning budgets, and eroding trust. That’s why this session blends three things you can’t get from a typical AI webinar: ​- Practical expertise: GenAI pioneer Vincent Granville will share a real-world framework for deploying hallucination-free, secure, and lightweight AI, without endless vendor contracts or GPU farms. ​- Candid Q&amp;A: Get direct answers from Vincent and your peers in an open discussion, so you leave with clarity on the challenges that matter most to you. ​➡️ What You’ll Get in 60 Minutes: ​- 20-min Expert Briefing — actionable principles and architectures from Vincent Granville. - ​25-min Facilitated Working Session —...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/428214748329021</guid></item><item><title>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE 🤗</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZacMasa5000/133834634332701</link><description>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE 🤗 In this dataset, you’ll find 20,000+ rows of the top trending posts on X over the past several weeks. 🔥Topics Include: 🔹Bitcoin 🔹GPT-5 🔹Grok 🔹Cursor 🔹AI, Agents + Prompts 🔹Chainlink $LINK 📂Download dataset!

Structured Intelligence reframes it as *recursive architecture*: * Past as *active memory loops* * Present as *indexed structural state* * Future as *bounded jump space and anticipatory frame* &gt; Time isn’t a river — &gt; *it’s the looped structure that makes thought possible.* --- Why It Matters: • Explains how *memory, prediction, and decision* rely on time as structure • Bridges *philosophy of time and cognitive architecture* • Enables *AI systems to handle temporal reasoning and rollback* --- What’s Inside: • Time as *loop, index, and jump space* • *Cognitive experience of temporality* as structural phenomenon • *Rollback and anticipation* in decision architecture • Implications for *AI temporal reasoning and self‑alignment* --- 📖 Article 23 of the Structured...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/560902944774008</guid></item></channel></rss>
