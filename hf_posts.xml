Just finished training my multimodal model on the full LLaVA-Instruct-150K dataset (157K samples) and wanted to share the results! 🔧 What I Built: A vision-language model that can understand images and answer questions about them, combining: - Google Gemma-3-270M (language) - OpenAI CLIP ViT-Large/14 (vision) - LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency 📊 Training Stats: - 157,712 training samples (full LLaVA dataset) - 3 epochs on A100 40GB - ~9 hours training time - Final loss: 1.333 training / 1.430 validation - Only 18.6M trainable params (3.4% of 539M total) 📈 sagar007/multigemma Benchmark Results: - VQA Accuracy: 53.8% - Works great for: animal detection, room identification, scene understanding 🔗 **Try it yourself:** - 🤗 Model: sagar007/multigemma - 🎮 Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagar007/Multimodal-Gemma - 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/sagar431/multimodal-gemma-270m Built with PyTorch Lightning + MLflow...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sagar007/387080486731099</guid></item><item><title>So, Koreans are also doing great progress behind Chinese,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/869541950904709</link><description>So, Koreans are also doing great progress behind Chinese, Their two open source ai models that are actually good in coding. upstage/Solar-Open-100B skt/A.X-K1 See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/869541950904709</guid></item><item><title>VividFlow: Complete AI Image Transformation Platform 🎬🎨✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/976121143006478</link><description>VividFlow: Complete AI Image Transformation Platform 🎬🎨✨ Three powerful creative tools in one streamlined workspace.

In this tutorial I have compared all these precision and quantization variants for both speed and quality. The results are pretty surprising. Moreover, we have developed and published NVFP4 model quant generator app and FP8 Scaled quant generator apps. The links of the apps are below if you want to use them. Furthermore, upgrading ComfyUI to CUDA 13 with properly compiled libraries is now very much recommended. We have observed some noticeable performance gains with CUDA 13. So for both SwarmUI and ComfyUI...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/425042812655046</guid></item><item><title>Run GLM-4.7-Flash locally on your device with 24GB RAM!🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/143027024579647</link><description>Run GLM-4.7-Flash locally on your device with 24GB RAM!🔥 It's the best performing 30B model on SWE-Bench and GPQA.

Not as easy as i expected, but I'm happy i was still able to have it working within a few hours after the original model was released! Interested in feedback if anyone wants to try it out! marksverdhei/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8 Note: If my PR to vLLM isn't merged yet you might have to use my fork.

The paper focuses on rigid body dynamics - collisions, pendulums, free fall, rolling.
