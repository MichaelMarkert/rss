Available today! üîµ In the blue corner, the versatile challenger with a proven track record of knowledge retrieval: LlamaIndex! üõë In the red corner, the defender, weighing in with lightweight efficiency: Hugging Face smolagents! üîó URL: https://huggingface.co/agents-course We just published the LlamaIndex unit for the agents course, and it is set to offer a great contrast between the smolagents unit by looking at - What makes llama-index stand-out - How the LlamaHub is used for integrations - Creating QueryEngine components - Using agents and tools - Agentic and multi-agent workflows The team has been working flat-out on this for a few weeks. Supported by Logan Markewich and Laurie Voss over at LlamaIndex. Who won? You decide!

I just came across a groundbreaking new tool called KGGen that's solving a major challenge in the AI world - the scarcity of high-quality knowledge graph data. KGGen is an open-source Python package that leverages language models to extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from plain text. What makes it special is its innovative approach to clustering related entities, which significantly reduces sparsity in the extracted KGs. The technical approach is fascinating: 1. KGGen uses a multi-stage process involving an LLM (GPT-4o in their implementation) to extract entities and relations from source text 2. It aggregates graphs across sources to reduce redundancy 3. Most importantly, it applies iterative LM-based clustering to refine the raw graph The clustering stage is particularly innovative - it identifies which nodes and edges refer to the same underlying entities or concepts. This normalizes variations in tense, plurality,...</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:20:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/815565847250252</guid></item><item><title>Hi there!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Undi95/824593315166092</link><description>Hi there! If you want to create your own thinking model or do a better MistralThinker, I just uploaded my entire dataset made on Deepseek R1 and the axolotl config. (well I made them public) Axolotl config : Undi95/MistralThinker-v1.1 The dataset : Undi95/R1-RP-ShareGPT3 You can also read all I did on those two discord screenshot from two days ago, I'm a little lazy to rewrite all kek. Hope you will use them!

What makes this dataset unique, useful, and capable of bridging the Sim2Real gap? üí† The digital twins are not generated by AI, but instead crafted by 3D artists to be INDISTINGUISHABLE from the physical-world objects. This allows the training from this data to transfer into real-world applicability üí† The simulation software, called FalconEditor, can easily create thousands of images with varying lighting, posing, occlusions, backgrounds, camera positions, and more. This enables robust model training. üí† The labels are created along with the data. This not only saves large amounts of time, but also ensures the...</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:20:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/775086617889949</guid></item><item><title>Published a stable version of Ukrainian Text-to-Speech library on GitHub and PyPI.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Yehor/619825346186306</link><description>Published a stable version of Ukrainian Text-to-Speech library on GitHub and PyPI.

Answering questions like, ‚Äòwhat is a reward?‚Äô and ‚Äòhow do we create an environment for a language model?‚Äô - Then it focuses on Deepseek R1 by walking through the paper and highlighting key aspects. This is an old school way to learn ML topics, but it always works. - Next, it takes to you Transformers Reinforcement Learning and demonstrates potential reward functions you could use. This is cool because it uses Marimo notebooks to visualise the reward. - Finally, Maxime walks us through a real training notebook that uses GRPO to reduce generation length. I‚Äôm really into this because it works and Maxime took the time to validate it share assets and logging from his own runs for you to compare with....</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:20:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/281561952705692</guid></item><item><title>ü´∏ New release to push vector search to the Hub with vicinity and work with any serialisable objects.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davidberenstein1957/915880767531433</link><description>ü´∏ New release to push vector search to the Hub with vicinity and work with any serialisable objects. üßë‚Äçüè´ KNN, HNSW, USEARCH, ANNOY, PYNNDESCENT, FAISS, and VOYAGER. üîó Example Repo: minishlab/my-vicinity-repo See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:20:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/davidberenstein1957/915880767531433</guid></item><item><title>I was puzzled by the scope of üêãDeepSeeküêã projects, i.e. why they built (then open sourced) so many pieces which are all over their technology stack.

Good engineers are minimalists. They build only when they have to. Then I realized that FP8 should be the main driving force here. So your raw inter-GPU bandwidth is cut in half (H800). But if you compress your data presentation from 16 bits to 8 bits, then the effective throughput of your workload stays unchanged! The idea is simple but lots of work had to be done. Their v3 technical report will give you a wholistic view (better than reading the code). To summarize, data structure is the foundation to any software. Since FP8 was new and untried, the ecosystem wasn't there. So DeepSeek became the trailblazer.
