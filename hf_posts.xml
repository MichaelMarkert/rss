So I built something to help. Stories of families torn apart, U.S. citizens detained for hours, people arrested just for speaking Spanish. This isn't the America I believe in. Instead of doom-scrolling, I spent a few days building FIREWATCH - a free civil rights protection app. What it does: ‚Ä¢ Real-time ICE raid alerts ‚Ä¢ Know Your Rights education in 10+ languages ‚Ä¢ Secure evidence recording ‚Ä¢ Emergency panic button ‚Ä¢ Legal hotlines and resources ‚Ä¢ 100% private, no tracking The catch? There isn't one. You just need a free Google API key that stays on your device. Works completely offline. https://firewatch-ice.vercel.app/ I built this because everyone deserves constitutional protection. The 4th Amendment doesn't have an asterisk. If this helps one family stay safe, every sleepless night was worth it. Please share with anyone who needs it. Stay safe.

"Because he found his honey!" This was the "funniest" joke out of 10'000 jokes we generated with LLMs. With 68% of respondents rating it as "funny". Original jokes are particularly hard for LLMs, as jokes are very nuanced and a lot of context is needed to understand if something is "funny". Something that can only reliably be measured using humans. LLMs are not equally good at generating jokes in every language. Generated English jokes turned out to be way funnier than the Japanese ones. 46% of English-speaking voters on average found the generated joke funny. The same statistic for other languages: Vietnamese: 44% Portuguese: 40% Arabic: 37% Japanese: 28% There is not much variance in generation quality among models for any fixed language. But still Claude Sonnet 4 slightly outperforms others in Vietnamese, Arabic and Japanese and Gemini 2.5 Flash in Portuguese and English We have release the 1 Million (!) native speaker ratings and the 10'000 jokes...</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 13:40:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/847126227827487</guid></item><item><title>üì¢ Generate your own data in simulation using two new free and customizable data-generating Scenarios on Duality's FalconCloud service.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/377698831818015</link><description>üì¢ Generate your own data in simulation using two new free and customizable data-generating Scenarios on Duality's FalconCloud service. üôå These multi-class Scenarios are designed to target model weaknesses for our recent Kaggle competition, but they are free to anyone for non-commercial use!

After doing more than 1 day more research with MultiTalk by using 8x A6000 48 GB GPUs, I have significantly improved the MultiTalk workflows and now I am sharing 4 different category workflows with you. VRAM usages and speeds are same but just better quality and animation. Moreover I am introducing a new app which is image and video comparison sliders. Ultra fast and lightweight. Runs as a html app and no GPU is required. https://youtu.be/wgCtUeog41g MultiTalk Full Tutorial With 1-Click Installer - Make Talking and Singing Videos From Static Images &gt; https://youtu.be/8cMIwS9qo4M By using MeiGen MultiTalk you can generate amazing fully animated real-like videos from given audio input.
