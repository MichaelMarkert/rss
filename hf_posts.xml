Given a financial event, it provides explained predictions based on a dataset of past news and central bank speeches. Try it out here: SelmaNajih001/StockPredictionExplanation (Just restart the space and wait a minute) The dataset used for RAG can be found here: SelmaNajih001/FinancialNewsAndCentralBanksSpeeches-Summary-Rag While the dataset used for the training is: SelmaNajih001/FinancialClassification I also wrote an article to explain how I've done the training.

At ü§ó Transformers, we do it with explicit software-engineering tenets, principles that make the codebase hackable at scale. üîç Inside the post: ‚Äì One Model, One File: readability first ‚Äî you can still open a modeling file and see the full logic, top to bottom. ‚Äì Modular Transformers: visible inheritance that cuts maintenance cost by ~15√ó while keeping models readable. ‚Äì Config-Driven Performance: FlashAttention, tensor parallelism, and attention scheduling are config-level features, not rewrites. Written with @ lysandre ,@pcuenq and @ yonigozlan , this is a deep dive into how Transformers stays fast, open, and maintainable.

I would be grateful if you could check it and upvote on HuggingFace Daily Papers - Reactive Transformer (RxT) -- Stateful Real-Time Processing for Event-Driven Reactive Language Models (2510.03561) Architecture is based on stateful real-time processing with innovational asynchronous memory update. Instead of reprocessing all the conversation history for each message, it's processing only single query with all the context moved to dedicated memory layers. Memory is updated after generating the answer, so it's not influencing latency - in tests, time to first token was almost the same as generating a single token. It has also better quality/accuracy in multi-turn dialogue than the same size stateless decoder-only model. Initial experiments were small scale (12M to 160M params models trained on simple synthetic datasets), but just now I'm starting training of bigger 270M params model on...</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:25:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdamF92/854077189361039</guid></item><item><title>8 Emerging trends in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/610901061800000</link><description>8 Emerging trends in Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is having a moment - and not just this week. Some of its directions are already showing huge promise, while others are still early but exciting. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs happening right now in RL: 1. Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) ‚Üí Reinforcement Pre-Training (2506.08007) Reframes next-token pretraining as RL with verifiable rewards, yielding scalable reasoning gains 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) ‚Üí Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences (1706.03741) The top approach. It trains a model using human preference feedback, building a reward model and then optimizing the policy to generate outputs people prefer 3. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) ‚Üí Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs (2506.14245) Moves from subjective (human-labeled) rewards to objective ones that can be automatically verified, like in...</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:25:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/610901061800000</guid></item><item><title>AI for Scientific Discovery Won't Work Without Fixing How We Collaborate.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/evijit/733521758778057</link><description>AI for Scientific Discovery Won't Work Without Fixing How We Collaborate. My co-author @ cgeorgiaw and I just published a paper challenging a core assumption: that the main barriers to AI in science are technical. They're not. They're social. Key findings: üö® The "AI Scientist" myth delays progress: Waiting for AGI devalues human expertise and obscures science's real purpose: cultivating understanding, not just outputs. üìä Wrong incentives: Datasets have 100x longer impact than models, yet data curation is undervalued. ‚ö†Ô∏è Broken collaboration: Domain scientists want understanding. ML researchers optimize performance. Without shared language, projects fail. üîç Fragmentation costs years: Harmonizing just 9 cancer files took 329 hours. Why this matters: Upstream bottlenecks like efficient PDE solvers could accelerate discovery across multiple sciences. CASP mobilized a community around protein structure, enabling AlphaFold. We need this for dozens of challenges. Thus, we're launching...</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:25:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/evijit/733521758778057</guid></item><item><title>Cool stuff these past weeks on huggingface! ü§ó üöÄ !</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/lunarflu/216355671043435</link><description>Cool stuff these past weeks on huggingface! ü§ó üöÄ ! ‚Ä¢ üìàTrackio, local-first W&amp;B alternative https://github.com/gradio-app/trackio/issues ‚Ä¢ üåçEmbeddingGemma, 300M-param, multilingual embeddings, on-device https://huggingface.co/blog/embeddinggemma ‚Ä¢ üíªOpen LLMs in VS Code (Inference Providers) https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1966185427582497171 ‚Ä¢ ü§ñSmol2Operator GUI agents https://huggingface.co/blog/smol2operator ‚Ä¢ üñºÔ∏èGradio visible watermarking https://huggingface.co/blog/watermarking-with-gradio See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:25:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lunarflu/216355671043435</guid></item><item><title>I found it excellent and very well done.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/229668569857091</link><description>I found it excellent and very well done.
