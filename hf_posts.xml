In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. 📤 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt; are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is &lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|user|&gt;. 📏 Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:23:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752</guid></item><item><title>NEW RELEASE: UML Generator is here!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sequelbox/444247492534501</link><description>NEW RELEASE: UML Generator is here! - Our newest Experimental Reasoning release: create Unified Modeling Language diagrams to provide analysis and insight into your queries and situations! - Multi-step reasoning reliably identifies diagram structure before a user response of XMI 2.5.1 code containing the UML diagram.

This fine tuned Gemma3 4B variant has a distinct, friendly, and exploratory persona - designed to help the user think and reflect. Atom is trained to ask questions, use approachable, yet relatable analogies in ELI5-style explanations, and engage in deep, reflective conversation. We plan to scale Atom's persona to larger architectures, and this iteration was created as part of that R&amp;D. Any and all feedback is always welcome as we continue to refine our approach.

Instead of viewing an AI agent as a monolithic process, we’ve decomposed it into four core tools that separate decision-making from execution — a design that’s proving critical for scale and observability: 🧩 MemoryTool – maintains persistent context and user continuity ✅ CompletionTool – determines when a task is truly complete 💬 UserInteractionTool – manages clarifications, approvals, and confirmations 🔁 DelegationTool – enables agents to hand off tasks to other agents or humans This approach makes every step of an agent’s workflow explicit, testable, and auditable, allowing us to scale AI systems in production with higher confidence. We see this as a step toward a more open, composable agent ecosystem — one where frameworks can interoperate and agents can...</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:23:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/TravisMuhlestein/389636099872687</guid></item></channel></rss>
