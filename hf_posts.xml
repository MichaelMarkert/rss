This tension is especially visible in conversational systems, where safeguards can sometimes feel more paternalistic than supportive. In my latest piece for Hugging Face, I argue that open source and community-driven approaches offer a promising (though not exclusive) way forward. ‚ú® Transparency can make safety mechanisms into learning opportunities. ‚ú® Collaboration with diverse communities makes safeguards more relevant across contexts. ‚ú® Iteration in the open lets protections evolve rather than freeze into rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Of course, this isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. Top-down safety measures will still be necessary in some cases. But if we only rely on corporate control, we risk building systems that are safe at the expense of trust and autonomy.

Here are 12 useful MCP servers that will help you create convenient agentic ecosystems: 1. Chrome DevTools MCP ‚Üí https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp Lets your coding agent (Gemini, Claude, Cursor, Copilot) control a live Chrome browser with full DevTools access for automation, debugging, and performance analysis 2. Windows-MCP ‚Üí https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP Provides interaction between agents and Windows, handling file navigation, app control, UI actions, QA testing 3. MCPControl ‚Üí https://github.com/claude-did-this/MCPControl Windows control server for programmatic control of mouse, keyboard, window management, and screen capture 4. MetaMCP ‚Üí https://github.com/metatool-ai/metamcp A proxy that aggregates multiple MCP servers into one, with middleware support. Works as a standard MCP server for any client 5....</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 05:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/566496725881885</guid></item><item><title>Quietly launched the largest Open source Free LateX Dataset -https://huggingface.co/datasets/dalle2/Bibby-AI-Latex-Tool-Overleaf-Alternative</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dalle2/895181701155114</link><description>Quietly launched the largest Open source Free LateX Dataset -https://huggingface.co/datasets/dalle2/Bibby-AI-Latex-Tool-Overleaf-Alternative See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 05:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/dalle2/895181701155114</guid></item><item><title>Now You Can Edit Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets With Claude AI and Wan Training Has Arrived.

It's poorly documented, but the code should be straightforward. https://github.com/jim-plus/llm-abliteration The code is built atop a fork that enabled abliteration to be performed on models loaded in 4-bit or 8-bit bitsandbytes quantization. TransformerLens is not required, just plain Transformers. For those previously unaware, this opens up abliteration experimentation to more people with local VRAM limitations. Since performing abliteration on a quant involves precision and perplexity loss, it stands to reason that a small amount of magnitude sparsification could filter out some noise and possibly even reduce the damage inflicted on latent space via ablation of the refusal vector. There's a small but real acceleration of ablation of the refusal vector by reducing outer product operations from O(d¬≤√ón) to O(d√ón), and then by pushing said computation layerwise to GPU. The code is hardcoded for...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 05:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/grimjim/556474107312531</guid></item><item><title>‚úÖ New Article: *Epilogue ‚Äî Genius as Reproducible Structure*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/517613830750903</link><description>‚úÖ New Article: *Epilogue ‚Äî Genius as Reproducible Structure* Title: üîç Epilogue: The Limits of Demonstration üîó https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/reproducing-genius-epilogue --- Summary: This arc showed that what history called *genius* is not ineffable. It is a *protocol* ‚Äî reproducible, auditable, teachable. Three demonstrations (acting/self-reference, math/nonverbal, martial/cosmic) were enough to prove the point. Genius was never about *who* did it, but *how* structure makes such leaps possible. &gt; To end the myth of genius &gt; is to begin its practice by everyone. --- Why It Matters: ‚Ä¢ Demystifies genius, reframing it as systematic structural method ‚Ä¢ Shows why only a few demonstrations are sufficient ‚Äî reproducibility is the proof ‚Ä¢ Opens the door for education, AI, and research to cultivate genius procedurally --- What‚Äôs Inside: ‚Ä¢ Recap of the protocol and its demonstrations ‚Ä¢ Reflection on why ‚Äúenough examples‚Äù suffices structurally ‚Ä¢ Implications: from talent myths to...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 05:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/517613830750903</guid></item><item><title>üêæ Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? üê±üíñ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ethank01/155417923515007</link><description>üêæ Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? üê±üíñ With iMini‚Äôs Nano Banana sticker template, you can turn your cat‚Äôs photo into adorable nine-grid stickers üé®‚ú®.
