With native whopping 2560x2560 pixels image output capability and with only 12 steps it is next level. With our installers and specially made Quant FP8 Scaled model, you can run this amazing beast even as low as 6 GB GPUs. In this tutorial, I have compared Qwen Image Edit 2511 with previous successor model Qwen Image 2509 with 12 different unique and hard prompts and cases. Everything is step by step explained and provided.

That said, we know many developers are comfortable with the classic layout (Postman / Bruno-style), where multiple sections can stay open at once.What would you prefer? - A new, focused single-section layout - The classic multi-section layout - A toggle that lets you choose between both?

They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.

Key findings from our research on optimal architectures for small language models: → Depth beats width: 32 layers outperforms 12 layers at the same parameter count → Best-in-class factuality: 47.5% on TruthfulQA → 10x training efficiency using WSD (Warmup-Stable-Decay) conversion → Canon layers add only 0.13% parameters but improve reasoning We trained on 1B tokens using the optimal 50-30-20 dataset mix (PDFs + filtered web + educational content), then converted to diffusion with just 100M additional tokens.

LFM2-2.6B-Exp is notable for how it was trained: it is an RL-first experimental checkpoint, built without supervised fine-tuning warm-up or distillation. Reinforcement learning was applied sequentially, starting with instruction following and later expanding to knowledge and math. This makes it a particularly interesting model to evaluate beyond benchmark scores. In hands-on testing, the model performed surprisingly well for its size on standard undergraduate-level differential equations—first-order ODEs, second-order linear equations with constant coefficients, and nonhomogeneous problems using undetermined coefficients. It followed instructions closely and produced clear, structured solution steps. However, the model showed limitations on more subtle methods,...</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Javedalam/903512733694185</guid></item><item><title>🦀 **Why Rust is the Ultimate Language for AI-Era Computing**</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sadpig70/682096883486252</link><description>🦀 **Why Rust is the Ultimate Language for AI-Era Computing** In 2025, **Google, Meta, AWS, Microsoft, and HuggingFace** are all betting big on Rust. Here's why: ✅ **Zero GC pauses** — No unpredictable latency spikes ✅ **C++ speed** — With compile-time memory safety ✅ **Fearless concurrency** — Data races eliminated at compile time 📊 **Real results:** - Google: Memory vulnerabilities down **1000x** in Android - Discord: Latency spikes **completely eliminated** (Go → Rust) - Python → Rust rewrites: **96% faster** response times &gt; *"The safer path is now also the faster path."* — Google **The future of long-running, large-scale AI systems is Rust.** 🔗 #Rust #AI #SystemsProgramming #Performance #MemorySafety #BigTech #SoftwareEngineering See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sadpig70/682096883486252</guid></item></channel></rss>
