The most notable regression vs the base model here is in arithmetic - if your workload is math heavy this model demonstrates an unfortunate collapse with performance under growing complexity. The interesting combination of awesome overall performance on SVG simple shapes identification coupled with a total inability to recognize more complex shapes like 'House' or 'Arrow' is a behavior directly inherited from the base model (but with a ~20% improvement in token utilization). If you like your reasoning models token-efficient, Aquif-3.5-8B-Think is well worth a spin.

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐋𝐄𝐁 — 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤. A suite of 10 high-quality English legal IR datasets, designed by legal experts to set a new standard for comparing embedding models. Whether you’re exploring legal RAG on your home computer, or running enterprise-scale retrieval, apples-to-apples evaluation is crucial. That’s why we’ve open-sourced everything - including our 7 brand-new, hand-crafted retrieval datasets. All of these datasets are now live on Hugging Face. Any guesses which embedding model leads on legal retrieval? 𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐭: it’s not OpenAI or Google - they place 7th and 9th on our leaderboard. To do well on MLEB, embedding models must demonstrate both extensive legal domain knowledge and strong legal reasoning skills. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 13:31:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abdurrahmanbutler/994710514786612</guid></item><item><title>MLEB  is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</link><description>MLEB is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 13:31:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</guid></item><item><title>AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/wenhuach/917073841450527</link><description>AutoRound keeps evolving its LLM quantization algorithm! 🚀 After enhancing W2A16 quantization, we now offer a fast algorithm to generate mixed bits/data-type schemes (~2mins for 8B models), great for MXFP4 and W2A16.

But at GoDaddy, we’re going deeper: starting from first principles to explore what makes an agent truly robust and usable in real-world scenarios. Instead of asking “What can we build fast?” we’re asking “What design choices make agents flexible, testable, and reliable long term?” Core Concepts • Tool-centric design: everything an agent does is a tool call, with precise APIs and granularity. • Decision vs. delivery: agents decide what to do; tools handle how to do it—keeping systems modular. • Structured outputs &amp; reflection: LLMs output both the tool call and the reason behind it, making debugging and iteration easier. • Universal tools: even user interactions (inform, confirm, request) are abstracted as tools, clarifying boundaries between logic and interface.
