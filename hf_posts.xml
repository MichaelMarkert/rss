He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference. As a thank you to the community, he shared 100 invite code first-come first serve, just use “HUGGINGFACE” to get access!

Incredible group to be part of - each person is doing groundbreaking work at the intersection of AI and journalism. Worth following them all: they're consistently sharing practical insights on building the future of news. Take the time to read this report, it's packed with insights as always. The news &amp; information section's #1 insight hits hard: "The most substantive economic impact of AI to date has been licensing payouts for a handful of big publishers. The competition will start shifting in the year ahead to separate AI 'haves' that have positioned themselves to grow from the 'have-nots.'" This AI-driven divide is something I've been really concerned about. Now is the time to build more than ever! 👉 Full report here: https://ftsg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FTSG_2025_TR_FINAL_LINKED.pdf See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:19:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/473088205866195</guid></item><item><title>📢 For those who interested in quick extraction of emotion causes in dialogues, below is a notebook that adopts the pre-trained Flan-T5 model on FRIENDS dataset powered by bulk-chain framework:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/947679817144983</link><description>📢 For those who interested in quick extraction of emotion causes in dialogues, below is a notebook that adopts the pre-trained Flan-T5 model on FRIENDS dataset powered by bulk-chain framework: https://gist.github.com/nicolay-r/c8cfe7df1bef0c14f77760fa78ae5b5c Why it might be intersted to check?

However, smaller models may require repeated calls to a tool or even fail to utilize it entirely. Therefore, this initial example focuses on the get_todo_issue() tool.
