It is an advanced LoRA adaptation of the Qwen-Image model and an upgraded version of prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism , offering more precise portrait rendering with a strong focus on realism. The model was trained on diverse face types from across the world, labeled with florence2-en and caption-optimized using prithivMLmods/DeepCaption-VLA-7B . 11(types) × 5 different face types: Asian, Hispanic, Caucasian, Latina, Middle Eastern, etc. ⮞ Model🤗: prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-HeadshotX ⮞ The Previous Adapter (LoRA): prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism ⮞ Collection: prithivMLmods/qwen-image-exp-lora-68a978fe11400bc3165b0c4d . . .

I explored the Environments Hub and wrote a walkthrough showing how to train and evaluate models using these open environments. 1️⃣ 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗥𝗟 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀 DeepSeek-R1 made clear that Reinforcement Learning can be used to incentivize reasoning in LLMs. In GRPO, the model generates multiple answers and learns to prefer the better ones from rewards. 2️⃣ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 In classic RL, the environment is the world where the Agent lives, interacts, and get rewards to learn. We can also think of them as software packages, containing data, harness and scoring rules - for the model to learn and be evaluated. Nowadays, the Agent is not just the LLM. It can use tools, from a weather API to a terminal. This makes environments for training and evaluation more complex and critical. 3️⃣ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 Big labs...</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:20:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/373269745519376</guid></item></channel></rss>
