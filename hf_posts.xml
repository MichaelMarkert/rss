First, I've created a dataset with Wikipedia's "Cat" article text in 272 languages: Norod78/WikiCat-Multilingual For each language entry with at least 100 words, I tokenized the text using 12 tokenizers and calculated the "Characters per token" ratio and "Word per token" ratio. The higher this ratio is, the more information each token represents on average for that language (and perhaps allowing the llm to potentially learn more per-parameter if trained on a dataset of that language). You can see a slideshow summary of the results here: https://norod.github.io/wikicat-tokenizer-eval/tokenizer-slideshow.html I hope I interpreted the results correctly, I've made the code available on GitHub so you can re-create the raw results jsonl with this repo: https://github.com/Norod/wikicat-tokenizer-eval Post on X: https://x.com/Norod78/status/1984366900550266999 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Norod78/977626760436669</guid></item><item><title>*** Happy Halloween - Embrace the Horror ! ***</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DavidAU/433692013361833</link><description>*** Happy Halloween - Embrace the Horror ! *** Unsloth fine tunes using in house horror dataset.

And yes, those matter immensely. But here's what nobody tells you: when your training run fails at 2 AM because of mysterious 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫𝐬, or when your expensive GPU cluster is running at 𝟔𝟎% 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, the problem isn't your model. It's most probably a 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞. 🛠️ Questions that seemed simple but had no clear answers: Why is 𝐌𝐨𝐄 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬? Which 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐬 should we actually set? How often should we checkpoint without killing throughput? That's why we built 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 📖: a complete guide covering everything from model architecture and data curation to the SmolLM3 training marathon, post-training techniques, and crucially, the 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 that most teams get wrong.

In recent weeks, numerous new PO methods have emerged that build on or replace the popular PPO and GRPO, solving their issues. Here are 11 of them: 1. BAlanced Policy Optimization (BAPO) → BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (2510.18927) Dynamically adjusting the clipping bounds in PPO-style updates to balance positive and negative gradients and prevent entropy collapse 2. Training-Free GRPO → Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (2510.08191) Instead of using numeric rewards, it compares rollouts semantically to distill useful knowledge as a token prior, which is then applied during inference to guide the model’s behavior 3. Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO) → ASPO: Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/468043722468280</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Medical-o1-Reasoning-SFT-Japanese dataset 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/591564562942305</link><description>Introducing the Medical-o1-Reasoning-SFT-Japanese dataset 🎉 This dataset is a Japanese dataset consisting questions, reasoning, and answer results for complex medical topics. #japanese #medical #dataset ronantakizawa/Medical-o1-Reasoning-SFT-Japanese See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/591564562942305</guid></item><item><title>New Datasets Published:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/973176037226952</link><description>New Datasets Published: vanta-research/poetic-imagery-small vanta-research/excitement-small We are open sourcing two of our datasets today, which were used in the training of Apollo Astralis 8B and 4B. The first dataset, poetic-imagery-small is designed to give the model's responses a bit of "depth" to them in order to encourage curiosity and thought from the user. Additionally, the excitement-small dataset is designed to teach the model how to use "excited" language conversationally. This dataset was used on both Apollo Astralis models, which effectively demonstrate general excitement during user interaction. VANTA Research is an AI safety project which aims to research and develop language models aligned for all types of thinking. These datasets were created aligned with that mission, in addition to rigorous AI safety standards.
