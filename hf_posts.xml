I think this is it, folks. o7 The unstarted spaces I can get behind. I would've appreciated a warning email first, but whatever. However, every time I restart the active usage goes up, despite all of my spaces being moved to CPU (free), and being paused.

Nice work, @ OwenArli ! ArliAI/GLM-4.5-Air-Derestricted Ablation on a MoE model is no small thing; I expect preserving norms/magnitudes during intervention better respects routing compared to naive refusal ablation. (I would have tagged their org, but that feature seems to be broken at the moment.)

ReubenOS is a virtual cloud-based operating system designed specifically to act as a backend for Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It gives Claude a persistent environment to work in! ✨ Key Features * 📱 Flutter IDE: Claude can write Flutter code and I can view/execute the files directly in the ReubenOS dashboard. * 🎵 AI Audio Studio: Integrated with ElevenLabs to generate songs and voiceovers from text prompts within Claude. * 🔒 Secure File System: A passkey-protected file system (private &amp; public folders) to store code, JSON, and documents. * 🧠 Gemini Integration: Access Google's Gemini model directly inside the OS. * 📝 Quiz Engine: Ask Claude to "Create a Python quiz," and it deploys a graded interactive quiz to the web instantly.

Maybe we have better LLM model in brain than that of cat and dog? 猫和狗都拥有像人类一样的强化学习能力、视觉和听觉。而且它们跑跳等方面的表现甚至比擎天柱还要出色。为什么人类可以饲养猫和狗呢？或许我们的大脑拥有比猫狗更优秀的大语言模型？ See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:36:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/431236892313740</guid></item><item><title>Interested in RL training environments?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/841067327080467</link><description>Interested in RL training environments?

It lets an AI models navigate a room, interpret a scene, or figure out how objects fit together, like giving it a built-in mental map. For example, world models can't live without spatial intelligence. Here are 6 good reads to explore what spatial intelligence is and how it's evolving: 1. From Words to Worlds: Spatial Intelligence is AI’s Next Frontier by Fei-Fei Li → https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence Fei-Fei Li, the godmother of AI, is a key figure in spatial intelligence, since her work in computer vision, especially ImageNet, helped AI learn to recognize and understand objects in space. She's recently started a blog, and this post, in particular, argues that true intelligence requires grounding in space, understanding geometry, motion and...</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:36:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/693757616060963</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the japanese-trending-words dataset: a dataset consisting 593 words from Japan’s annual trending word rankings (流行語大賞) from 2006-2025.
