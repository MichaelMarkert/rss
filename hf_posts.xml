But what does it actually mean when an LLM is “thinking”? Imagine a chess player pausing before their next move not because they don’t know how to play, but because they’re running through possibilities, weighing options, and choosing the best one. LLMs do something similar… except they’re not really thinking like us. Here’s the surprising part :- You might think these reasoning skills come from futuristic architectures or alien neural networks. In reality, most reasoning LLMs still use the same transformer decoder-only architecture as other models The real magic? It’s in how they’re trained and what data they learn from. Can AI actually think, or is it just insanely good at faking it? I broke it down in a simple, 4-minute Medium read. Bet you’ll walk away with at least one “aha!” moment. 🚀 Read here - https://lnkd.in/edZ8Ceyg See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:30:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/RakshitAralimatti/207934490136479</guid></item><item><title>benchmarked 9 models in 3 days. they were mostly below average in AHA score. p(doom) probably increased :(</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/891816438009932</link><description>benchmarked 9 models in 3 days. they were mostly below average in AHA score. p(doom) probably increased :( See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:30:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/891816438009932</guid></item><item><title>Want to learn to build an AI Agent?
