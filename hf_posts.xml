In short: it's a very tiny Transformers, but it loops over itself at two different frequencies, updating two latent variables: one for the proposed answer and one for the reasoning. @ AlexiaJM started from the paper Hierarchical Reasoning Model, published a few months ago, that already showed breakthrough improvement on AGI for its small size (27M) Hierarchical Reasoning Model had introduced one main feature: 🔎 Deep supervision In their model, one part (here one layer) would run at high frequency, and...</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/175050207181959</guid></item><item><title>At the close of the National Holiday🇨🇳, Antgroup drops a new SoTA model.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/255762505303069</link><description>At the close of the National Holiday🇨🇳, Antgroup drops a new SoTA model.

In our new blog post with Dr. Sasha Luccioni, we argue that separating them (as is too often the case) means missing the bigger picture of how AI systems impact both people and the planet. Ethical and sustainable AI development can’t be pursued in isolation. The same choices that affect who benefits or is harmed by AI systems also determine how much energy and resources they consume. We explore how two key concepts, evaluation and transparency, can serve as bridges between these domains: 📊 Evaluation, by moving beyond accuracy or performance metrics to include environmental and social costs, as we’ve done with tools like the AI Energy Score. 🔍 Transparency, by enabling reproducibility, accountability, and environmental reporting through open tools like the Environmental Transparency Space. AI systems mirror our priorities. If we separate ethics from sustainability, we risk building technologies that are efficient but...</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/452837154929545</guid></item><item><title>🎉 NEW RELEASES: Cosmos Predict 2.5 and Transfer 2.5</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jwgu/145606397801534</link><description>🎉 NEW RELEASES: Cosmos Predict 2.5 and Transfer 2.5 Cosmos Predict 2.5: - Combines Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World - Multimodal, future-state video prediction Cosmos Transfer 2.5: - High-fidelity multicontrol world simulations - Inputs: RGB, depth, segmentation—blended seamlessly These updates boost development of autonomous vehicles, robotics, and video analytics.

I’ve ported the BDH ( https://github.com/pathwaycom/bdh ) model to MLX for Apple Silicon. It’s a faithful conversion of the PyTorch version: same math, same architecture (byte-level vocab, shared weights across layers, ReLU sparsity, RoPE attention with Q=K), with MLX-friendly APIs and a detailed README explaining the few API-level differences and why results are equivalent. Code, docs, and training script are ready to use. You may need to adjust the training script a bit to fit your own custom dataset. Only tested on M4 so far, but should work perfect for any M1/M2/M3 users out there. I’m currently training this MLX build on my Internal Knowledge Map (IKM) dataset Severian/Internal-Knowledge-Map Training’s underway; expect a day or so before I publish weights. When it’s done, I’ll upload the checkpoint to Hugging Face for anyone to test.

For years, robotics has been locked behind high prices and complex systems. So we decided to change that. Today, we’re open-sourcing Ark-Bot — a fully 3D-printed, 6-DOF robot arm that works seamlessly with our Python robotics library, Ark. And yes… It’s only £215.86 to build. 🧠ArkBot Specs 🧠 1️⃣ Reach: 1 meter 2️⃣ Weight: 2.6 kg 3️⃣ Payload: 1.8 kg 💪 4️⃣ DOF: 6 5️⃣ Input Voltage: DC 12V 🤟Fully 3D-printable &amp; open-source 🤟Integrated with Ark — no ROS required 📹 We’ve also released a video showing the full assembly process — because robotics should be something everyone can learn, build, and improve on. 👩‍🎓 With Ark-Bot, anyone — from students to AI researchers — can experiment with embodied AI, robot learning, and control algorithms on real hardware, affordably. If you could control a 1-meter robot arm from your laptop for under £220… 👉 What would you build first? 🔗https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_bot 🎥...</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hba123/315319549896319</guid></item><item><title>Ovi is Local Version of VEO 3 &amp; SORA 2 - The first-ever public, open-source model that generates both VIDEO and synchronized AUDIO, and you can run it on your own computer on Windows even with a 6GB GPUs - Full Tutorial for Windows, RunPod and Massed Compute - Gradio App</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/350754844731753</link><description>https://youtu.be/T00VmkMQRPQ Ovi is Local Version of VEO 3 &amp; SORA 2 - The first-ever public, open-source model that generates both VIDEO and synchronized AUDIO, and you can run it on your own computer on Windows even with a 6GB GPUs - Full Tutorial for Windows, RunPod and Massed Compute - Gradio App Tutorial : https://youtu.be/T00VmkMQRPQ Forget waiting lists and expensive APIs.

When identity meets comparison, the mind computes *delta-to-others* (status, attention, resources). If that delta breaches a threshold without a repair path, the loop escalates into resentment. Structured Intelligence makes this computable — and containable. &gt; Envy compares levels. &gt; *Integrity compares trajectories.* --- Why It Matters: • Turns envy from shame into an *auditable signal* (where, when, and why comparison spikes) • Provides *de-escalation protocols* for individuals, teams, and platforms • Guides product/organization design to reduce perceived unfairness and burnout --- What’s Inside: • The Envy Loop: *trigger →...</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:17:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/689097395708339</guid></item></channel></rss>
