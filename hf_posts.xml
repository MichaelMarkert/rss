It continues proving its effectiveness, especially in top-performing reasoning models. However, there are other similar methods, that expand CoT and can be used for different purposes. Here are 9 of them: 1. Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) -&gt; Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search (2502.02508) Helps model decide when to keep thinking, double-check their work, or try a different approach, using special guiding tokens. 2. Chain of Draft (CoD) -&gt; Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less (2502.18600) It helps model generate short but meaningful reasoning steps, cutting costs and making processing faster 3. Chain-of-Agents -&gt; Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks (2406.02818) Uses multi-agent...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/433849056207490</guid></item><item><title>made a few improvements on custom grpo trainer:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/982484477481896</link><description>made a few improvements on custom grpo trainer: - added sequence similarity reward (seems to work) - improved vllm support (5x inference speed) - adjusted reward scores (this helped with format/accuracy) - can now push to hf hub (already pushed mine lol: Jaward/smollm2_360m_grpo_gsm8k_reasoner ) Code: https://github.com/Jaykef/ai-algorithms/blob/main/smollm2_360M_135M_grpo_gsm8k.ipynb See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/982484477481896</guid></item><item><title>Exciting New Tool for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Plain Text!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/815565847250252</link><description>Exciting New Tool for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Plain Text! I just came across a groundbreaking new tool called KGGen that's solving a major challenge in the AI world - the scarcity of high-quality knowledge graph data. KGGen is an open-source Python package that leverages language models to extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from plain text. What makes it special is its innovative approach to clustering related entities, which significantly reduces sparsity in the extracted KGs. The technical approach is fascinating: 1. KGGen uses a multi-stage process involving an LLM (GPT-4o in their implementation) to extract entities and relations from source text 2. It aggregates graphs across sources to reduce redundancy 3. Most importantly, it applies iterative LM-based clustering to refine the raw graph The clustering stage is particularly innovative - it identifies which nodes and edges refer to the same underlying entities or concepts. This normalizes variations in tense, plurality,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/815565847250252</guid></item><item><title>Introducing a new architecture, MedIT One ‚Äì a single-token transformer with LSTM-like recurrence.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mkurman/255930071052172</link><description>Introducing a new architecture, MedIT One ‚Äì a single-token transformer with LSTM-like recurrence.

I have been tinkering with quantization and pruning to reduce model sizes. So far, I've had modest success in producing, on average, 8% smaller versions with negligible loss of quality, and I think further reductions in the 10-15% range are realistic, but I've come across a behaviour I wasn't expecting! Part of the process I'm following consists of quantizing the embedding and output layers aggressively. Since the embedding layer is more about lookup than complex computation, the vectors representing the relative distances between embeddings are usually preserved well enough making this layer fairly robust to quantization. So far, so good. The output layer, on the other hand, maps the final hidden state to the vocabulary logits and therefore, small changes in these logits could lead to a different probability distribution over the vocabulary, resulting in incorrect word predictions, or so I thought. Surprisingly, I'm finding that even at Q2_K the loss of...</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/832567461491467</guid></item><item><title>I think we have released the best Arabic model under 25B at least based on</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MohamedRashad/233650928001403</link><description>I think we have released the best Arabic model under 25B at least based on inceptionai/AraGen-Leaderboard Yehia = ALLaM-AI/ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview + GRPO and its ranked number one model under the 25B parameter size mark. Now, i said "i think" not "i am sure" because this model used the same metric of evaluation the AraGen developers use (the 3C3H) as a reward model to improve its responses and this sparks the question. Is this something good for users or is it another type of overfitting that we don't want ? I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing but what i know is that you can try it from here: Navid-AI/Yehia-7B-preview or Download it for your personal experiments from here: Navid-AI/Yehia-7B-preview Ramada Kareem üåô See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MohamedRashad/233650928001403</guid></item><item><title>Wan 2.1 AI Video Model: Ultimate Step-by-Step Tutorial for Windows &amp; Affordable Private Cloud Setup :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/359700355865540</link><description>Wan 2.1 AI Video Model: Ultimate Step-by-Step Tutorial for Windows &amp; Affordable Private Cloud Setup : https://youtu.be/hnAhveNy-8s https://youtu.be/hnAhveNy-8s Please check all screenshots to see latest news and updates after the tutorial video Alibaba‚Äôs new Wan 2.1 text-to-video, video-to-video and image-to-video Open Source AI is unbelievable.
