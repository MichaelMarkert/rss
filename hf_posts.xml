Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -&gt; InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -&gt; CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -&gt; ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 13:31:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893</guid></item><item><title>🎨 BadgeCraft: Create Beautiful Badges with Ease! ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fantos/270713260226473</link><description>🎨 BadgeCraft: Create Beautiful Badges with Ease! ✨ Hello there!

These models are essentially SFT fine-tuned with the data generated by larger models, and the SFT+RL combo does not disappoint. This is verified in the DeepSeek-R1 paper. 2/ both GRPO and PPO algorithms suffer from length bias; they encourage longer responses. This can be tackled by introducing explicit rewards based on the length of the answer. 3/Most reasoning research is focused on code and math. But training models on logic puzzles improves them for mathematical tasks too. This shows the RL reasoning is generalized beyond the specific domain knowledge. Previous research also shows RL can be a great generalizer. 4/The reasoning might not be only induced by RL; it might already be hidden in the base models due to the pre-training and CoT data they were trained on. So while RL does wake up the...</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 13:31:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/296461908562882</guid></item></channel></rss>
