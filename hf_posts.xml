Ark just got a major upgrade: We’ve now integrated Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) into Ark 🎉 VLAs = models that connect vision + language → robot actions (see image) What does this mean? 🗣️ Give robots natural language instructions → they act 👀 Combine perception + language for real-world control 🦾 Powered by pi0 pretrained models for fast prototyping ⚡ Supports easy data collection and fine-tuning within Ark within a couple of lines of code Next, we plan to go into the world of designing worlds 😉 Who knows, maybe those video models are actually zero-shot learners and reasoners? Check it out here 👉 https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_framework Check out the tutorial 👉 https://arkrobotics.notion.site/VLA-Pi0-with-Ark-279e053d9c6f800ab0a2d498835dd96b ⭐ Star the repo, try it with your robots, and let us together make robots great (again?)!

New release Embedding Generation for Videos. With our latest ApertureDB AI workflow, you can now generate embeddings for video frames &amp; clips and store them directly in a multimodal database—ready for semantic search, RAG, or agentic use cases. 🎬 See It In Action: https://youtu.be/X2ZXE0EEAkk 🔎 Example use cases: Natural language search across video libraries Highlight reel creation &amp; scene retrieval Safer content moderation Lecture indexing + video-to-text alignment Multimodal RAG (text + images + video) ✨ Check out the demo notebook to see how you can: Import videos from S3 Generate embeddings per frame/clip Query videos with natural language (“show me a baby”) 👉 Try it here: https://shorturl.at/jSNtu Turn your video library into a fully searchable knowledge base. No scrubbing—just instant, semantic video results. We’d love your feedback and ideas on how you would use it.
