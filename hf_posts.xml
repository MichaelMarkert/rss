Here are 9 fresh policy optimization techniques worth knowing: 1. GSPO: Group Sequence Policy Optimization → Group Sequence Policy Optimization (2507.18071) Shifts from token-level to sequence-level optimization, clipping, and rewarding to capture the full picture and increase stability compared to GRPO. GSPO-token variation also allows token-level fine-tuning. 2. LAPO: Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization → LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (2507.15758) A two-stage RL framework that trains models to adaptively control reasoning length by learning typical solution lengths for shorter and more efficient reasoning. 3. HBPO: Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization → Hierarchical Budget Policy...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/659752309280422</guid></item><item><title>Explore OCR, Captioning, and Visual Understanding with Cutting-Edge Models on Hugging Face. 🤗🧪</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/591329511468798</link><description>Explore OCR, Captioning, and Visual Understanding with Cutting-Edge Models on Hugging Face. 🤗🧪 I’ve put together a collection of Google Colab notebooks to experiment with some of the most exciting models available on the Hugging Face Hub focused on OCR, image captioning, and visual understanding tasks. [Image-to-Text] / [Image-Text-to-Text] &gt; 📖 OCR-ReportLab-Notebooks : prithivMLmods/OCR-ReportLab-Notebooks These notebooks are built for quick prototyping and run on free T4 GPUs, making them perfect for experimentation, testing ideas, or just exploring what’s possible with modern vision-language models. Note: The experimental notebooks are compiled with models that fit within the T4 GPU (free-tier) limits. More models along with their notebooks will be added over time.

AI's all about the data! 📊📚) The impact of the template will depend on how effectively it establishes a minimum meaningful transparency standard for companies that don't otherwise offer any transparency into their handling of e.g. personal data or (anti?-)competitive practices in commercial licensing - we'll see how those play out as new models are released after August 2nd 👀 In the meantime, I wanted to see how the template works for a fully open-source + commercially viable model, so I filled it out for the SmolLM3 - which my colleagues at Hugging Face earlier this month 🤗 ICYMI, it's fully open-source with 3B parameters and performance matching the best similar-size models (I've switched all my local apps from Qwen3 to it, you should...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/544574162514620</guid></item><item><title>🛡️ At Ai4Privacy, our goal is to empower researchers to build a safer AI ecosystem.

Today, we're highlighting crucial research that does just that by exposing a new vulnerability. The paper "Forget to Flourish" details a new model poisoning technique. It's a reminder that as we fine-tune LLMs, our anonymization and privacy strategies must evolve to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy dataset was instrumental in this study. It served two key purposes: Provided a Realistic Testbed: It gave the researchers access to a diverse set of synthetic and realistic PII samples in a safe, controlled environment. Enabled Impactful Benchmarking: It allowed them to measure the actual effectiveness of their data extraction attack, proving it could compromise specific, high-value information. This work reinforces our belief that progress in AI security is a community effort. By providing robust tools for benchmarking, we can collectively identify weaknesses and...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/228428153197540</guid></item><item><title>🤯 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336</link><description>🤯 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license internlm/Intern-S1 internlm released Intern-S1: multimodal reasoning model based on 235B MoE Qwen3 and 6B InternViT 😍 benchmarks look great (👑 best model ✅ best open model) See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336</guid></item><item><title>We just released TRL v0.20 with major multimodal upgrades!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/236970560808195</link><description>We just released TRL v0.20 with major multimodal upgrades! 👁️ VLM support for GRPO (highly requested by the community!) 🎞️ New GSPO trainer (from @ Qwen , released last week, VLM-ready) 🐙 New MPO trainer (multimodal by design, as in the paper) 📝 Full release notes here: https://github.com/huggingface/trl/releases/tag/v0.20.0 See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/236970560808195</guid></item><item><title>NEW EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE: DAG Reasoning is here!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sequelbox/481535699199098</link><description>NEW EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE: DAG Reasoning is here! - Our first Experimental Reasoning Modality release: create structured, analytical Directed Acyclic Graphs to provide insight into your queries and situations! - Multi-step analysis identifies causal relationships, produces confidence measurements, and forms a single structured graph object. - DAG Reasoning Format provides clear, readable JSON containing structured, useful information; easy to use for creating visualizations, doing analysis, or further conversation with your assistant. - Trained in a variety of subjects for flexible analysis: programming, science, business, economics, finance, law, logistics, management, and more!
