Models: Qwen/qwen3-67dd247413f0e2e4f653967f Blog: https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/ Demo: Qwen/Qwen3-Demo GitHub: https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3 ✅ Pre-trained 119 languages(36 trillion tokens) and dialects with strong translation and instruction following abilities. (Qwen2.5 was pre-trained on 18 trillion tokens.) ✅Qwen3 dense models match the performance of larger Qwen2.5 models. For example, Qwen3-1.7B/4B/8B/14B/32B perform like Qwen2.5-3B/7B/14B/32B/72B. ✅ Three stage done while pretraining: • Stage 1: General language learning and knowledge building. • Stage 2: Reasoning boost with STEM, coding, and logic skills. • Stage 3: Long context training ✅ It supports MCP in the model ✅ Strong agent skills ✅ Supports seamless between thinking mode (for hard tasks like math and coding) and non-thinking mode (for fast chatting) inside chat...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/337137510653930</guid></item><item><title>𝗜 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗥𝗣𝗢! 👑 🗓️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/692858936883406</link><description>𝗜 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗥𝗣𝗢! 👑 🗓️ ✍️ Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo I experimented with GRPO lately. I am fascinated by models learning from prompts and rewards - no example answers needed like in Supervised Fine-Tuning. After the DeepSeek boom, everyone is trying GRPO with GSM8K or the Countdown Game... I wanted a different challenge, like 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀. Choosing an original problem forced me to: 🤔 Think about the problem setting 🧬 Generate data 🤏 Choose the right base model 🏆 Design reward functions (and experiencing reward hacking) 🔄 Run multiple rounds of training, hoping that my model would learn something. A fun and rewarding 😄 experience. I learned a lot of things, that I want to share with you. 👇 ✍️ Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 💻 Code: https://github.com/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 🤗 Hugging Face collection...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/692858936883406</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Excited to Share Our Latest Work: In-Context Edit: Enabling Instructional Image Editing with In-Context Generation in Large Scale Diffusion Transformer～</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sanaka87/703703147958180</link><description>🚀 Excited to Share Our Latest Work: In-Context Edit: Enabling Instructional Image Editing with In-Context Generation in Large Scale Diffusion Transformer～ 🎨 Daily Paper: In-Context Edit: Enabling Instructional Image Editing with In-Context Generation in Large Scale Diffusion Transformer (2504.20690) 🔓 Code is now open source! 🔥 Huggingface DEMO: RiverZ/ICEdit 🌐 Project Website: https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/ 🏠 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/blob/main/scripts/gradio_demo.py 🤗 Huggingface: sanaka87/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA 📄 arxiv Paper: In-Context Edit: Enabling Instructional Image Editing with In-Context Generation in Large Scale Diffusion Transformer (2504.20690) 🔥 Why it’s cool: - Achieves high-quality, multi-task image editing. - Uses only 1% of the training parameters and 0.1% of the training data compared to existing methods — extremely efficient - Beats several commercial models on background preservation, ID control, and consistency - Open-...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sanaka87/703703147958180</guid></item><item><title>Meta released Llama Guard 4 and new Prompt Guard 2 models 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/662080130760638</link><description>Meta released Llama Guard 4 and new Prompt Guard 2 models 🔥 Llama Guard 4 is a new model to filter model inputs/outputs both text-only and image 🛡️ use it before and after LLMs/VLMs! meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B Prompt Guard 2 22M &amp; 86M are smol models to prevent model jailbreaks and prompt injections ⚔ meta-llama/Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-22M meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B Both come with new release of transformers 🤗 Try the model right away 👉🏻https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/blob/main/llama_guard_4.ipynb Read our blog to learn more and easily get started 👉🏻 https://huggingface.co/blog/llama-guard-4 🦙 See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/662080130760638</guid></item><item><title>🖼️ SVGFind Icons Dataset -</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nyuuzyou/112237159992701</link><description>🖼️ SVGFind Icons Dataset - nyuuzyou/svgfind Collection of 3,655,810 Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons featuring: - Sourced from SVGFind across diverse categories &amp; styles - Includes metadata: unique ID, title, tags, data pack, and license information - Contains minified SVG markup for direct use or processing - Organized into splits based on license type (Creative Commons: 3,645,444 icons, Public Domain: 10,366 icons) With over 3.6 million icons, this appears to be the largest SVG dataset on Hugging Face to date.

Excited to share a new feature from the Gradio team along with a tutorial. If you don't already know, Gradio is an open-source Python library used to build interfaces for machine learning models. Beyond just creating UIs, Gradio also exposes API capabilities and now, Gradio apps can be launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for LLMs. If you already know how to use Gradio, there are only two additional things you need to do: * Add standard docstrings to your function (these will be used to generate the descriptions for your tools for the LLM) * Set mcp_server=True in launch() Here's a complete example (make sure you already have the latest version of Gradio installed): import gradio as gr def letter_counter ( word, letter ): """Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word. Args: word: The word or phrase to analyze letter: The letter to count occurrences of Returns: The number of times the letter appears in the word """ return...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/767083410530735</guid></item><item><title>DeepSeek, Alibaba, Skywork,  Xiaomi, Bytedance.....</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/438609555040169</link><description>DeepSeek, Alibaba, Skywork, Xiaomi, Bytedance.....

(2023) in a reasoning context. (paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10379 ) The dataset simulates the discovery phase of a fictitious VC firm called Reasoned Capital and, once expanded, can be used to create models which are able to make complex, subjective financial decisions based on different criteria. The generation process encourages recursive problem-solving in increasingly complex prompts to encourage models to assess and reevaluate the conclusions and generated opinions of upstream models. Pretty neat stuff, and I'm not aware of this architecture being used in a reasoning context anywhere else.
