Instead of viewing an AI agent as a monolithic process, we’ve decomposed it into four core tools that separate decision-making from execution — a design that’s proving critical for scale and observability: 🧩 MemoryTool – maintains persistent context and user continuity ✅ CompletionTool – determines when a task is truly complete 💬 UserInteractionTool – manages clarifications, approvals, and confirmations 🔁 DelegationTool – enables agents to hand off tasks to other agents or humans This approach makes every step of an agent’s workflow explicit, testable, and auditable, allowing us to scale AI systems in production with higher confidence. We see this as a step toward a more open, composable agent ecosystem — one where frameworks can interoperate and agents can...</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 09:27:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/TravisMuhlestein/389636099872687</guid></item><item><title>I'm thrilled to launch SUP Toolbox!

It extends the Hugging Face Transformers interface with TPU-aware features such as automatic sharding, custom attention kernels, and quantization-aware loading, making large-scale deployment and training both simpler and faster. With quantization and Splash Attention kernels, AutoXLA achieves up to 4× speedups over standard Flash Attention implementations, significantly improving throughput for both inference and training workloads. Whether you’re experimenting with distributed setups (FSDP, 2D, or 3D sharding) or optimizing memory via LanguageModelQuantizer, AutoXLA is built to make scaling LLMs on TPU seamless. ⚠️ Note: This is an experimental repository. Expect rough edges! Please report bugs or unexpected behavior through GitHub issues. 🔗 GitHub Repository:...</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 09:27:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/780653085928819</guid></item><item><title>Try the all-new trending Qwen-Image-Edit specialized adapter demos, including Photo-to-Anime, Light Restoration, Multi-Angle Edits, Relighting, and more — all in a single Hugging Face Space.

This fine tuned Gemma3 4B variant has a distinct, friendly, and exploratory persona - designed to help the user think and reflect. Atom is trained to ask questions, use approachable, yet relatable analogies in ELI5-style explanations, and engage in deep, reflective conversation. We plan to scale Atom's persona to larger architectures, and this iteration was created as part of that R&amp;D. Any and all feedback is always welcome as we continue to refine our approach.
