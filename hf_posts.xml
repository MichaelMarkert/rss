I have done over 64 different unique Wan 2.2 trainings to prepare the very best working training configurations for you. The configurations are fully working locally with as low as 6 GB GPUs. So you will be able to train your awesome Wan 2.2 image or video generation LoRAs on your Windows computer with easiness. Moreover, I have shown how to train on cloud platforms RunPod and Massed Compute so even if you have no GPU or you want faster training, you can train on cloud for very cheap prices fully privately.

I've discovered that my repository John1604/Kimi-K2-Thinking-q6K-gguf isn't getting enough downloads and is nearly consuming 1TB of storage. While I love Kimi K2's way of thinking, I have to delete this model because it's a true open-source 1TB LLM, comparable to any cutting-edge LLM model. In the AI ​​race, four US companies have 1TB+ models: xAI, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. China also has four companies with 1TB+ models: Alibaba, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GLM. Currently, the two sides are evenly matched. Only American team and Chinese team have LLM with 1T+ parameters. Let's cheer for them to reach AGI in next 5 to 10 years. Maybe a 64T chinese model will do it -- Human and cat brain...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/712509372180068</guid></item><item><title>arXiv CS endorsement</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/telcom/422373414213997</link><description>arXiv CS endorsement It's Javad, my Google Scholar Profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bja6GwoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en I would like to share my articles with you on Hugging Face, I'm asking for endorsement* in Computer Science arxiv.org.

The next year is going to be a year of context engineering which expands beyond prompt engineering. The two complement each other: prompt engineering shapes how we ask, while context engineering shapes what the model knows, sees, and can do. To keep things clear, here are the main techniques and design patterns in both areas, with some useful resources for further exploration: ▪️ 9 Prompt Engineering Techniques (configuring input text) 1. Zero-shot prompting – giving a single instruction without examples. Relies entirely on pretrained knowledge. 2. Few-shot prompting – adding input–output examples to encourage model to show the desired behavior. ⟶ https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 3. Role prompting – assigning a persona or role (e.g. "You are a senior researcher," "Say it as a specialist in...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/746586334382009</guid></item><item><title>🧬⚕️🔬 Encoding the World's Medical Knowledge into 970K!

That friction slows teams down especially when people use different setups. At Voiden, we believe your API artifacts should work anywhere your team does. Our files open seamlessly in VS Code, GitHub, custom Electron clients, and more, without being locked into a specific workspace or tool. Key benefits: -Portability across editors, repos, platforms, and team setups -No proprietary workspace: the repo is the workspace -Easy integration with CI pipelines, linters, and future tools -Future-proof your API workflows with open and flexible artifacts Voiden empowers devs and teams collaborate and stay agile as tools and platforms evolve.

Instead of only matching surface-level preferences, the system now implements a multi-dimensional semantic reasoning architecture that emphasizes real-life compatibility and risk awareness. Key technical improvements: - SBERT-powered semantic understanding with dynamic weight allocation across six constraint dimensions (space, activity, noise, grooming, experience, family) - Hierarchical constraint management distinguishing critical safety constraints from flexible preferences, with progressive relaxation when needed -Multi-head scoring system combining semantic matching (15%), lifestyle compatibility (70%), constraint adherence (10%), and confidence calibration (5%) -Intelligent risk filtering that applies graduated penalties (-10% to...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/213826857024975</guid></item><item><title>We have open-sourced Robust-R1 (AAAI 2026 Oral), a new paradigm in the field of anti-degradation and robustness enhancement for multimodal large models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314</link><description>We have open-sourced Robust-R1 (AAAI 2026 Oral), a new paradigm in the field of anti-degradation and robustness enhancement for multimodal large models. Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314</guid></item><item><title>How do you protect your prompts without breaking them?

You need a smart sanitizer. A new system called Prϵϵmpt shows how. The first, critical step in their solution is a high-performance Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to find the sensitive data. We're proud to see that these researchers, Amrita Roy Chowdhury, David Glukhov, Divyam Anshumaan, Prasad Chalasani, Nicolas Papernot, Somesh Jha, and Mihir Bellare from the University of Michigan, University of Toronto, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California, San Diego - Rady School of Management and Langroid Incorporated fine-tuned their NER model on 10 high-risk categories from the AI4Privacy dataset. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helps provide the foundation for the critical detection engine, which in turn enables the community to build and test better solutions like Prϵϵmpt's innovative use of encryption and Differential Privacy. 🔗 Check out their paper for a deep dive into a formally private,...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/649372647638290</guid></item></channel></rss>
