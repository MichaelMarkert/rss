This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -&gt; CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -&gt; Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns. Helps in plug-and-play tool use without training new...</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:22:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918</guid></item><item><title>Hello everyone, happy to share with you my experimentation of a Deep Research Assistant, using 7 agents and a quality assurance pipeline :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mallocode200/873699618032778</link><description>Hello everyone, happy to share with you my experimentation of a Deep Research Assistant, using 7 agents and a quality assurance pipeline : ü§ñ What makes this special: ‚úÖ Agent-Based Architecture - 7 specialised AI agents working together: - Planner Agent - Strategic search planning - Search Agent - Multi-source web research - Writer Agent - Comprehensive report generation - Evaluator Agent - Automatic quality assessment - Optimiser Agent - Iterative improvement when needed - Email Agent - Professional report delivery - Clarifier Agent - Interactive query refinement ‚úÖ Quality Assurance Pipeline - Every report is scored (1-10) and automatically improved if it scores below 7/10 ‚úÖ Multiple Research Modes - From quick queries to deep, clarification-driven analysis ‚úÖ Production-Ready - Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with comprehensive documentation üîß Technical Stack: - Frontend: Gradio with theme-adaptive UI - Backend: OpenAI Agents framework - Integration: SendGrid for email delivery -...</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:22:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mallocode200/873699618032778</guid></item><item><title>Hi everyone,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</link><description>Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been running small language models (SLLMs) directly on smartphones ‚Äî completely offline, with no cloud backend or server API calls. I wanted to share: 1. ‚ö° Tokens/sec performance across several SLLMs 2. ü§ñ Observations on hardware utilization (where the workload actually runs) 3. üìè Trade-offs between model size, latency, and feasibility for mobile apps There are reports for below models - QWEN3 0.6B - NVIDIA/Nemotron QWEN 1.5B - SimpleScaling S1 - TinyLlama - Unsloth tuned Llama 3.2 1B - Naver HyperClova 0.5B üìúComparable Benchmark reports (no cloud, all on-device): I‚Äôd really value your thoughts on: - Creative ideas to further optimize inference under these hardware constraints - Other compact LLMs worth testing on-device - Experiences you‚Äôve had trying to deploy LLMs at the edge If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôm happy to share more details on the test setup, hardware specs, or the tooling we used for these comparisons.
