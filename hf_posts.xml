For me, that was the key factor that accelerated scientific progress and made the impossible possible—just look at the “T” in ChatGPT, which comes from the Transformer architecture openly shared by Google. Then came the myth that AI was too dangerous to share, and companies started optimizing for short-term revenue. That led many major AI labs and researchers to stop sharing and collaborating. With OAI and sama now saying they're willing to share open weights again, we have a real chance to return to a golden age of AI progress and democratization—powered by openness and collaboration, in the US and around the world. This is incredibly exciting. Let’s go, open science and open-source AI!

Unfortunately, the developer doesn't want to add feature to save trained Clip L or T5 XXL as safetensors or merge them into output so basically they are useless without so much extra effort. I still went ahead and wanted to test EMA training. EMA normally improves quality significantly in SD 1.5 training. With FLUX I have to use CPU for EMA and it was really slow but i wanted to test. I have tried to replicate Kohya config. The below you will see results. Sadly the quality is nothing sort of. More research has to be made and since we still don't get text-encoder training due to developer decision, I don't see any benefit of using OneTrainer for FLUX training instead of using Koha. 1st image : Kohya best config : https://www.patreon.com/posts/112099700 2nd image : One Trainer Kohya config with EMA update every 1 step...</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 05:21:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/151523216975273</guid></item><item><title>You can now run DeepSeek-V3-0324 on your own local device!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/465464088880734</link><description>You can now run DeepSeek-V3-0324 on your own local device!
