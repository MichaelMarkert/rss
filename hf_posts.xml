Complete and verbatim. Your strategic presentations, client details, personal conversations - it's all there, perfectly organized and searchable. We've been oversharing without realizing it. Some quick fixes: - Ask yourself: "Would I post this on LinkedIn?" - Use "Company A" instead of real names - Run models locally when possible Full breakdown: https://huggingface.co/blog/fdaudens/ai-chatbot-privacy-risks P.S.: Prompt doesn't work for everyone.

And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. 🎯 Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! 🧠 With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 05:23:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>🎨 ChartGPT: AI that Draws Diagrams and Designs from Natural Language</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/636657408260101</link><description>🎨 ChartGPT: AI that Draws Diagrams and Designs from Natural Language Hello!

So here is a fork that you can use, with some instructions on how to do this: jbilcke-hf/Wan2GP_you_must_clone_this_space_to_use_it#1 Note : some things like persistent models/storage/custom LoRAs might not be fully working out of the box. If you need those, you might have to dig into the Wan2GP codebase, see how to tweak the storage folder. Happy hacking!
