What is Git GUI, and how does it help here ? Git GUI makes version control visual, predictable, and easier to reason about especially when things go wrong. That’s exactly why we built Git GUI in Voiden. Instead of relying on memorized commands, Voiden lets you see what Git is doing before it does it. What Voiden’s Git GUI helps developers do • View exact file and line-level changes before committing • Stage only intended changes (no accidental commits) • Clearly distinguish staged vs unstaged files • Inspect visual diffs with full context • Understand branches, commit history, and repo state instantly When Git behavior is hidden, errors increase. Voiden’s Git GUI doesn’t abstract Git away, it explains Git. Whether you’re new to Git or an experienced developer who prefers clarity, this is Git you can reason about. Version control should feel safe, not stressful. What Git pain points slow you down today?...</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/142145591956765</guid></item><item><title>As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049</link><description>As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out Reubencf/Nano_Banana_Editor looking forward to build and release more in the future for the open source community See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049</guid></item><item><title>How to Use SwarmUI Presets &amp; Workflows in ComfyUI + Custom Model Paths Setup for ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/729956870553821</link><description>How to Use SwarmUI Presets &amp; Workflows in ComfyUI + Custom Model Paths Setup for ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s Full tutorial link &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s Info Generating workflow inside SwarmUI and using in ComfyUI is literally 1-click. In this tutorial I will show you how to use our 40+ amazing generative AI presets made for SwarmUI in ComfyUI with most easy way. You will be able to get very best outcomes of all AI models such as SDXL, FLUX, Z Image Turbo, Wan 2.1, Wan 2.2, FLUX 2, Qwen Image, Qwen Image Edit, FLUX Kontext, Image Outpainting, Image Inpainting and many more. Moreover, I will show how to use custom model paths in ComfyUI and SwarmUI to unify your models in same folder and avoid model duplication and save massive amount of disk space.

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

With 2–6 hours round-trip latency and intermittent links, an onboard SI-Core must act as a *local sovereign*—while remaining *globally accountable* to Earth. This note sketches how mission continuity survives when nobody is listening: DTN-style semantic bundles, local vs. global rollback, bounded self-improvement, and auditability that still works after contact windows return. &gt; Autonomy isn’t a divorce from governance— &gt; it’s a measured loan of authority, under a constitution, with evidence. --- Why It Matters: • Makes “autonomous” mean *operational*, not rhetorical, under light-hour delays • Clarifies how rollback...</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/622562072144954</guid></item><item><title>Runtime variables let you capture data from one API request and reuse it in the next.
