If you want to convert an existing Space, like this one hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS , so that you can use it with Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline / TinyAgents / or any LLM that supports MCP, here's all you need to do: 1. Duplicate the Space (in the Settings Tab) 2. Upgrade the Gradio sdk_version to 5.28 (in the README.md ) 3. Set mcp_server=True in launch() 4. (Optionally) add docstrings to the function so that the LLM knows how to use it, like this: def generate ( text, speed= 1 ): """ Convert text to speech audio. Parameters: text (str): The input text to be converted to speech. speed (float, optional): Playback speed of the generated speech. That's it! Now your LLM will be able to talk to you 🤯 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 17:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/810486848644944</guid></item><item><title>🎨 Renoir Studio: Impressionist Masterpieces Reborn Through AI ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/692850049335646</link><description>🎨 Renoir Studio: Impressionist Masterpieces Reborn Through AI ✨ 🌟 Experience Renoir's Magical Brushstrokes with AI! 🔗 Try it now: ginigen/flux-lora-renoir 🔗 Model page: openfree/pierre-auguste-renoir 🔗 Collection: openfree/painting-art-ai-681453484ec15ef5978bbeb1 Hello, AI art enthusiasts! 💖 Today I'm introducing a special model - Pierre-Auguste Renoir Studio.

Over the past few months, I explored how to build intelligent, autonomous agents using cutting-edge tools like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. The course covered everything from the fundamentals of agents to advanced topics like fine-tuning for function-calling, observability, evaluation, and even agents in games. Some key content included: 1. Introduction to AI Agents 2. Agentic RAG use cases 3. Multi-framework implementation: smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph 4. Building, testing, and certifying a complete agent project This was a hands-on, practical experience that deepened my understanding of how to design reliable, tool-using LLM agents. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and beyond. Many thanks to the Hugging Face team for putting this together. Let’s build safe and useful agents!

Just tested it with Steve Jobs' Stanford speech and was speechless (pun intended). The video isn’t sped up. 3 things that floored me: - Transcription took just 10 seconds for a 15-min file - Got a CSV with perfect timestamps, punctuation &amp; capitalization - Stunning accuracy (correctly captured "Reed College" and other specifics) NVIDIA also released a demo where you can click any transcribed segment to play it instantly. The improvement is significant: number 1 on the ASR Leaderboard, 6% error rate (best in class) with complete commercial freedom (cc-by-4.0 license). Time to update those Whisper pipelines! H/t @ Steveeeeeeen for the finding!

Excited to share a new feature from the Gradio team along with a tutorial. If you don't already know, Gradio is an open-source Python library used to build interfaces for machine learning models. Beyond just creating UIs, Gradio also exposes API capabilities and now, Gradio apps can be launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for LLMs. If you already know how to use Gradio, there are only two additional things you need to do: * Add standard docstrings to your function (these will be used to generate the descriptions for your tools for the LLM) * Set mcp_server=True in launch() Here's a complete example (make sure you already have the latest version of Gradio installed): import gradio as gr def letter_counter ( word, letter ): """Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word. Args: word: The word or phrase to analyze letter: The letter to count occurrences of Returns: The number of times the letter appears in the word """ return...</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 17:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/767083410530735</guid></item><item><title>VisionScout — Now with Scene Understanding! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/822045713383062</link><description>VisionScout — Now with Scene Understanding! 🚀 I'm excited to share a major update to VisionScout, my interactive vision tool that combines powerful object detection with emerging scene understanding capabilities! 👀🔍 What can VisionScout do today? 🖼️ Upload any image and detect 80 object types using YOLOv8. 🔄 Instantly switch between Nano, Medium, and XLarge models depending on speed vs. accuracy needs. 🎯 Filter specific classes (people, vehicles, animals, etc.) to focus only on what matters to you. 📊 View detailed statistics on detected objects, confidence levels, and spatial distribution. ⭐️ NEW: Scene understanding layer now added! - Automatically interprets the scene based on detected objects. - Uses a combination of rule-based reasoning and CLIP-powered semantic validation. - Outputs descriptions, possible activities, and even safety concerns.
