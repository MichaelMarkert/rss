So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI‚Äôs command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf &lt;resource&gt; &lt;action&gt;. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember? The full rationale, implementation details, and migration notes are in the blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-cli See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 17:23:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Wauplin/921235032674409</guid></item><item><title>I run Qwen3-Coder 480B locally on my Z8, with a 1-million token context window.

Right now, we're in the final stages of testing, and we're about to drop a game-changing milestone in the open-source AI community. üéâ In just two weeks, we've managed to almost 4x the size of the largest open-source LLM at that time (and we are still 2.6x bigger than the largest LLM). This is unprecedented and a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of pushing AI to its limits. The future of open-source AI is now. Stay tuned for the release ‚Äì we‚Äôre just getting started. - Model testing finishes: 24hrs from now - Model gets uploaded: 30hrs from now - Related code/inference stack gets published: 70-90hrs from now See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 17:23:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Blazgo/275361717193984</guid></item><item><title>Big respect to the Qwen team!

AI can turn that information into actionable intelligence‚Äîbut only with the right training data. In our latest blog, we explore how Falcon‚Äôs new virtual SAR sensor solves the SAR data bottleneck for AI development. As the newest addition to Falcon‚Äôs sensor library, it models radar returns with precision‚Äîincluding azimuth, range resolution, signal intensity, and noise. This Falcon-specific, GPU-accelerated raytraced SAR model is exposed via Falcon‚Äôs Python API, giving teams precise, control over radar wave propagation and enabling physically grounded, highly customizable, and user-friendly SAR simulation. The result? High-fidelity, automatically labeled synthetic SAR imagery from any scenario‚Äîon demand. No custom setup. No external workflows.
