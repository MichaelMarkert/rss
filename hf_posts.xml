While we’re not attending this year, we’re closely following the updates and today we pull together a quick, easy-to-digest roundup of a few standout papers so you can jump in without getting overwhelmed. Here is a list of 15 papers from NeurIPS 2025, including 8 top research papers that received awards, along with 7 others that caught our attention: 1. Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks → https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/test-of-time/128328 Test of Time Award winner. Introduces the RPN, a small convnet that predicts objectness and boxes on shared features, enabling Faster R-CNN to share computation and run around 5 fps on a GPU 2.

Our work on modeling data taxonomies led to new approaches for jointly clustering and mixing data distributions under data repetition penalties. Many improvements in our STEM abilities can be traced back to this.
