We just published a dataset using a new (for us) preference modality: direct ranking based on aesthetic preference. We ranked a couple of thousand images from most to least preferred, all sampled from the Open Image Preferences v1 dataset by the amazing @ data-is-better-together team. üìä Check it out here: Rapidata/2k-ranked-images-open-image-preferences-v1 We're really curious to hear your thoughts! Is this kind of ranking interesting or useful to you? Let us know! üí¨ If it is, please consider leaving a ‚ù§Ô∏è and if we hit 30 ‚ù§Ô∏ès, we‚Äôll go ahead and rank the full 17k image dataset!

This video shows how you can use the script to invoke the large language model. And then you get a description of a movie in a second or three.

Is that ethical or not? They could certainly do a better job by working with teams like llama.cpp, just like Qwen team did with Qwen 3 before releasing the model. In 2024 I started playing with LLMs just before the release of Llama 3. I think Meta contributed a lot to this field and still contributing. Most LLM fine tuning tools are based on their models and also the inference tool llama.cpp has their name on it. The Llama 4 is fast and maybe not the greatest in real performance but still deserves respect. But my enthusiasm towards Llama models is probably because they rank highest on my AHA Leaderboard: https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/open/mz41j09cc640a29ba47729fed784a263c1d08 Looks like they did a worse job compared to Llama 3.1 this time. Llama 3.1 has been on top for a while. Ranking high on my leaderboard is not correlated to...</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/726325088198598</guid></item><item><title>I have made a Rust project with integration of the latest state-of-the-art model for object detection, it outperforms YOLO!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Yehor/936075739202200</link><description>I have made a Rust project with integration of the latest state-of-the-art model for object detection, it outperforms YOLO!
