At roughly ~15M parameters, it runs fast on modest hardware, supports multiple expressive voices, and exposes simple controls for pacing and tone. This makes it ideal for edge devices, demos, and anyone who wants full control over TTS without latency, lock-in, or infrastructure overhead.

This article reframes evaluation as a *goal surface*: multi-objective, role-aware, and ethics-bounded. In SI-Core terms, experiments become *first-class Jumps (E-Jumps)* with explicit contracts, traces, and gates—so you can run A/B tests, shadow evals, and adaptive rollouts *without violating ETH, confusing principals/roles, or learning from unsafe data*. &gt; Don’t optimize a metric. &gt; Optimize a goal surface—under explicit constraints. --- Why It Matters: • Prevents Goodhart failures by treating evaluation as *multi-goal + constraints*, not a scalar leaderboard • Makes experimentation auditable: *EvalTrace* answers “what changed, for whom, why, and under what policy” •...</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 09:36:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/513254467148584</guid></item><item><title>LTX 2 &amp; Z Image Base Full Tutorial + Audio to Video Lip Sync + ComfyUI + SwarmUI + Windows + Cloud</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/813967180726808</link><description>LTX 2 &amp; Z Image Base Full Tutorial + Audio to Video Lip Sync + ComfyUI + SwarmUI + Windows + Cloud Full tutorial link &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc Info LTX 2 is the newest state of the art (SOTA) Open Source video generation model and tutorial will show you how to use it with very best and most performant way in ComfyUI and also in SwarmUI.
