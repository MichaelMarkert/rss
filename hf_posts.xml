Humans often solve visual problems by sketching ideas in our minds. What if Vision-Language Models (VLMs) could do something similar, not by generating full images, but by using internal “mental sketches”? That’s the idea behind Mirage, a new framework that empowers VLMs to reason using latent visual tokens. Instead of just thinking in words, Mirage mixes in abstract visual representations that help the model solve complex tasks. These aren't photorealistic images. They're compact, internal representations optimized purely to support reasoning. 🔧 Mirage is trained in two phases: 1) Grounding: It learns to produce latent tokens anchored in real images. 2) Refinement: The model drops the images and learns to generate visual tokens on its own. 📈 And yes, it works! On challenging benchmarks like Visual Spatial Planning, Jigsaw puzzles, and Spatial Attention Tasks, Mirage clearly outperforms GPT-4o and other strong baselines. Smart sketches &gt; empty words....</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:26:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/535116877809522</guid></item><item><title>If you're using any HF libraries, you should enable the Hub MCP in your agentic coding tool!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/145810386001131</link><description>If you're using any HF libraries, you should enable the Hub MCP in your agentic coding tool!

The biggest update yet introduces Sparse Embedding models, encode methods improvements, Router module for asymmetric models &amp; much more. Sparse + Dense = 🔥 hybrid search performance! Details: 1️⃣ Sparse Encoder Models Brand new support for sparse embedding models that generate high-dimensional embeddings (30,000+ dims) where &lt;1% are non-zero: - Full SPLADE, Inference-free SPLADE, and CSR architecture support - 4 new modules, 12 new losses, 9 new evaluators - Integration with @ elastic-co , @ opensearch-project , @ NAVER LABS Europe, @ qdrant , @ IBM , etc. - Decode interpretable embeddings to understand token importance - Hybrid search integration to get the best of both worlds 2️⃣ Enhanced Encode Methods &amp; Multi-Processing - Introduce encode_query &amp; encode_document automatically use predefined prompts - No more manual pool management - just pass device list directly to encode() - Much cleaner and easier to use than the old multi-process approach...</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:26:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/190568030432786</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview is Now Open Source!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/404767027882987</link><description>🎉 Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview is Now Open Source! The world's first Intermediate Thinking Model is now available to everyone! Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview brings revolutionary intermediate thinking capabilities to the open-source community. Unlike traditional reasoning models that think once, Dhanishtha can think, answer, rethink, answer again, and continue rethinking as needed using multiple blocks between responses. 🚀 Key Features - Intermediate thinking: Think → Answer → Rethink → Answer → Rethink if needed... - Token efficient: Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 on similar queries - Transparent thinking: See the model's reasoning process in real-time - Open source: Freely available for research and development HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-2.0-preview https://helpingai.co/chat See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:26:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/404767027882987</guid></item><item><title>🔥 June highlights from China’s open source ecosystem.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/923543336919000</link><description>🔥 June highlights from China’s open source ecosystem. zh-ai-community/june-2025-open-works-from-the-chinese-community-683d66c188f782dc5570ba15 ✨Baidu &amp; MiniMax both launched open foundation models - Baidu: Ernie 4.5 ( from 0.3B -424B ) 🤯 - MiniMax: MiniMax -M1 ( Hybrid MoE reasoning model ) ✨Multimodal AI is moving from fusion to full-stack reasoning: unified Any-to-Any pipelines across text, vision, audio, and 3D - Baidu: ERNIE-4.5-VL-424B - Moonshot AI: Kimi-VL-A3B - Alibaba: Ovis-U1 - BAAI: Video-XL-2/OmniGen2 - AntGroup: Ming-Lite-Omni - Chinese Academy of Science: Stream-Omni - Bytedance: SeedVR2-3B - Tencent: Hunyuan 3D 2.1/ SongGeneration - FishAudio: Openaudio-s1-mini ✨Domain specific models are rapidly emerging - Alibaba DAMO: Lingshu-7B (medical MLLM) - BAAI: RoboBrain (Robotics) ✨ So many small models! - OpenBMB: MiciCPM4 ( on device ) - Qwen: Embedding/Reranker (0.6B) - Alibaba: Ovis-U1-3B - Moonshot AI: Kimi-VL-A3B - Bytedance: SeedVR2-3B See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:26:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/923543336919000</guid></item><item><title>I played around with the new RXTX paper (XX^T) and was able to train nanogpt with 4x4 RXTX matmuls in both attention layer and optimizer🤕</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/639375924369190</link><description>I played around with the new RXTX paper (XX^T) and was able to train nanogpt with 4x4 RXTX matmuls in both attention layer and optimizer🤕 It just works (well I had to add some guardrails) but still saves 5% of memory usage: The Patch: - Computes attention scores with a 4x4 blockwise RXTX matmuls (no pytorch dot prod) - Handles arbitrary sequence lengths by padding to the nearest multiple of 4. - An RXTX variant of shampoo with params reshaped into 4x4 blocks during each optimizer step. - Uses 5% less ops Code: https://github.com/Jaykef/ai-algorithms/blob/main/nanogpt-rxtx.ipynb Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09814 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:26:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/639375924369190</guid></item><item><title>visual reasoning is now in  transformers 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/119393817203316</link><description>visual reasoning is now in transformers 🔥 THUDM/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking is just released and merged into transformers, we gave it a vibe test run 🤠 it's very good, comes with 64k context length and MIT license 😍 it supports 4k image tokens and any aspect ratio as well!
