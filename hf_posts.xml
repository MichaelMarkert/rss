I have literally shown 26 unique cases and provided demo images and prompts. After watching this tutorial your image editing skills will move to next level i promise you that. Also this tutorial will give you a lot of ideas.

WebGPU-accelerated semantic video tracking, powered by DINOv3 and Transformers.js! 🤯 Demo (+ source code): webml-community/DINOv3-video-tracking This will revolutionize AI-powered video editors... which can now run 100% locally in your browser, no server inference required (costs $0)! 😍 How does it work? 🤔 1️⃣ Generate and cache image features for each frame 2️⃣ Create a list of embeddings for selected patch(es) 3️⃣ Compute cosine similarity between each patch and the selected patch(es) 4️⃣ Highlight those whose score is above some threshold ... et voilà! 🥳 You can also make selections across frames to improve temporal consistency! This is super useful if the object changes its appearance slightly throughout the video. Excited to see what the community builds with it!

Model now shows step-by-step thinking in &lt;think&gt; tags before answering. Logic puzzle accuracy: 61% → 84%. 3 hours training on single GPU. 🧠 Used GRPO where model generates multiple responses and learns to prefer better reasoning. Works surprisingly well for making smaller models more transparent. 🔗 Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/codelion/ellora/blob/main/Ellora_Recipe_2_Reasoning_LoRA_with_Self-Rewarding_GRPO.ipynb 🤗 Model: codelion/gemma-3-1b-it-reasoning-grpo-lora 💻 Code: https://github.com/codelion/ellora See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:35:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/968650774475150</guid></item><item><title>🔒 Ansim Blur: Privacy-First Face Blurring for the AI Era</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/464899901167090</link><description>🔒 Ansim Blur: Privacy-First Face Blurring for the AI Era 🚨 The Privacy Crisis is Now Smart CCTVs 📹, delivery robots 🤖, and autonomous vehicles 🚗 are everywhere.
