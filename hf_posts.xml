The world's first Intermediate Thinking Model is now available to everyone! Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview brings revolutionary intermediate thinking capabilities to the open-source community. Unlike traditional reasoning models that think once, Dhanishtha can think, answer, rethink, answer again, and continue rethinking as needed using multiple blocks between responses. 🚀 Key Features - Intermediate thinking: Think → Answer → Rethink → Answer → Rethink if needed... - Token efficient: Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 on similar queries - Transparent thinking: See the model's reasoning process in real-time - Open source: Freely available for research and development HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-2.0-preview https://helpingai.co/chat See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:28:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/404767027882987</guid></item><item><title>Inference for generative ai models looks like a mine field, but there’s a simple protocol for picking the best inference:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/697123415535373</link><description>Inference for generative ai models looks like a mine field, but there’s a simple protocol for picking the best inference: 🌍 95% of users &gt;&gt; If you’re using open (large) models and need fast online inference, then use Inference providers on auto mode, and let it choose the best provider for the model. https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index 👷 fine-tuners/ bespoke &gt;&gt; If you’ve got custom setups, use Inference Endpoints to define a configuration from AWS, Azure, GCP. https://endpoints.huggingface.co/ 🦫 Locals &gt;&gt; If you’re trying to stretch everything you can out of a server or local machine, use Llama.cpp, Jan, LMStudio or vLLM. https://huggingface.co/settings/local-apps#local-apps 🪟 Browsers &gt;&gt; If you need open models running right here in the browser, use transformers.js. https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js Let me know what you’re using, and if you think it’s more complex than this.

It comes with an FAQ, great guides and examples on how to deploy VLMs, LLMs, smolagents and more to come very soon. We need your feedback: come help us and let us know what else you want to see, which model we should add to the collection, which model task we should prioritize adding, what else we should build a tutorial for.

This weekend I did some cleanup on my private repos I went 1.58 TB down to 1 GB. 😅 Besides deleting old, unused models, the main tool I used was a lesser-known command: super_squash_history . When you train a model, you often push multiple checkpoints to the Hub. Each checkpoint = a commit. A 2.6B model in BF16 is ~5 GB. So 10 checkpoints = 50 GB. That adds up fast. While full commit history can be useful for rollbacks, it's often unnecessary for older experiments where only the final model matters. In these cases, you can use super_squash_history : it reduces your entire repo history to a single commit. https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi.super_squash_history ⚠️ super_squash_history is a non-revertible operation. Once squashed, the commit history cannot be...</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:28:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/460502915743038</guid></item><item><title>📣 CALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS! 📣</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/945882073606324</link><description>📣 CALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS! 📣 Following last week’s full release of Gemma 3n, we launched a dedicated recipes repo to explore and share use cases. We already added some! 🧑‍🍳 Now we’re inviting the community to contribute and showcase how these models shine! ✨ Let them cook.
