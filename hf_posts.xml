It's smarter, faster, and now understands 119 languages instead of just 29. It can do both deep reasoning and quick answers using a single model, depending on what you need. The models range in size from small (0.6B) to huge (235B), with smart ways to save compute. It's trained on 36 trillion tokens and fine-tuned in four steps to boost performance. Qwen3 performs as well as or better than many top models, including some from big companies. It’s fully open-source under licence.

AA-LCR is 100 hard text-based questions that require reasoning across multiple real-world documents that represent ~100k input tokens. Questions are designed so answers cannot be directly found but must be reasoned from multiple information sources, with human testing verifying that each question requires genuine inference rather than retrieval. Key takeaways: ➤ Today’s leading models achieve ~70% accuracy: the top three places go to OpenAI o3 (69%), xAI Grok 4 (68%) and Qwen3 235B 2507 Thinking (67%) ➤👀 We also already have gpt-oss results! 120B performs close to o4-mini...</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 17:20:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/georgewritescode/981174566402338</guid></item><item><title>NEW RELEASE: Shining Valiant 3 now available for openai/gpt-oss-20b!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sequelbox/943110527199023</link><description>NEW RELEASE: Shining Valiant 3 now available for openai/gpt-oss-20b! - Cutting edge science-reasoning: sequelbox/Celestia3-DeepSeek-R1-0528 for physics, biology, chemistry, compsci, astronomy, Earth science, and information theory. - AI to build AI: the all-new sequelbox/Mitakihara-DeepSeek-R1-0528 dataset for high-quality reasoning performance on AI, MLOps, math and CUDA, complex adaptive and agentic systems, cognition, logic, linguistics, simulation, knowledge management, and more! - Creative reasoning and general chat performance supplemented with sequelbox/Raiden-DeepSeek-R1 Get the new SV3: ValiantLabs/gpt-oss-20b-ShiningValiant3 This is our first release for the new openai/gpt-oss-20b - we're hoping to support this model with more releases going forward.

I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation—on just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt–response pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn’t turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands “Oh great, another meeting” exactly as you mean it.
