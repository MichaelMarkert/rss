With frameworks like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangChain. üîó Follow the org for updates https://huggingface.co/agents-course This week we are releasing the first framework unit in the course and it‚Äôs on smolagents. This is what the unit covers: - why should you use smolagents vs another library? - how to build agents that use code - build multiagents systems - use vision language models for browser use The team has been working flat out on this for a few weeks. Led by @ sergiopaniego and supported by smolagents author @ m-ric .

To make a research survey, you generally follow two steps, preparation (collect and organize papers) and writing (outline creation, writing, polishing). Researchers followed the same two steps and automated them. üéØ For the preparation part, a key part is find all the important references on the given subject. Researchers first cast a wide net of all relevant papers. But then finding the really important ones is like distilling knowledge from a haystack of information. To solve this challenge, they built an ‚ÄúAttributeTree‚Äù object that structures key information from citations. Ablating these AttributeTrees significantly decreased structure and...</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 05:21:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/788543954757847</guid></item><item><title>üî• Agents can do anything!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/alvarobartt/393660009896131</link><description>üî• Agents can do anything! @ microsoft Research just announced the release of Magma 8B! Magma is a new Visual Language Model (VLM) with 8B parameters for multi-modal agents designed to handle complex interactions across virtual and real environments; and it's MIT licensed! Magma comes with exciting new features such as: - Introduces the Set-of-Mark and Trace-of-Mark techniques for fine-tuning - Leverages a large amount of unlabeled video data to learn the spatial-temporal grounding and planning - A strong generalization and ability to be fine-tuned for other agentic tasks - SOTA in different multi-modal benchmarks spanning across UI navigation, robotics manipulation, image / video understanding and spatial understanding and reasoning - Generates goal-driven visual plans and actions for agentic use cases Model: microsoft/Magma-8B Technical Report: Magma: A Foundation Model for Multimodal AI Agents (2502.13130) See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 05:21:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/alvarobartt/393660009896131</guid></item><item><title>Hello!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MrOvkill/644352837710754</link><description>Hello!

Been testing all these tools myself and created a searchable collection of the most practical ones - from audio transcription to image generation to document analysis. No coding needed, no expensive subscriptions. Some highlights I've tested personally: - Private, on-device transcription with speaker ID in 100+ languages using Whisper - Website scraping that just works - paste a URL, get structured data - Local image editing with tools like Finegrain (impressive results) - Document chat using Qwen 2.5 72B (handles technical papers well) Sharing this early because the best tools come from the community. Drop your favorite tools in the comments or join the discussion on what to add next! üëâ JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 05:21:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/982146976081521</guid></item></channel></rss>
