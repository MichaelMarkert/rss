Key Features &amp; Strengths Multi-Area Prompt Support Input distinct descriptions for the left, center, and right regions (e.g., "dense forest" for the left, "calm lake" for the center, and "majestic mountains" for the right). This allows the system to seamlessly blend multiple scenes into one stunning panoramic image. 🌄 Automatic Korean-to-English Translation If your prompt contains Korean text, it will be automatically translated into English before image generation. (For example, "안개 낀 산" becomes "Misty mountain") 🔄 This feature ensures that you can effortlessly use both English and Korean prompts. Advanced Tiling Technology The project uses a sophisticated tiling approach that manages overlapping regions to produce natural transitions and high-...</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:05:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fantos/903293233196599</guid></item><item><title>Time Stream ⏳🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/776720011919298</link><description>Time Stream ⏳🚀 Time Stream is a groundbreaking AI tool that transforms your text into a mesmerizing video journey from the past to the future.

It ranks #3 overall on our text-to-video human preference benchmark, but in terms of style and coherence, it outperforms even OpenAI Sora. However, it struggles with alignment, making it less predictable for controlled outputs. We've released a new dataset with human evaluations of Runway Gen-3 Alpha: Rapidata's text-2-video human preferences dataset. If you're working on video generation and want to see how your model compares to the biggest players, we can benchmark it for you. 🚀 DM us if you’re interested!

The filtered dataset contains 220k problems with correct reasoning traces. 📀 512 H100s running locally: Instead of relying on an API, we leverage vLLM and SGLang to run generations locally on our science cluster, generating 180k reasoning traces per day. ⏳ Automated filtering: We apply Math Verify to only retain problems with at least one correct answer. We also leverage Llama3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge to retrieve more correct examples (e.g for cases with malformed answers...</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:05:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lewtun/162100455547462</guid></item><item><title>📢 New Research Alert: Making Language Models Smaller &amp; Smarter!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/schuler/395413718646507</link><description>📢 New Research Alert: Making Language Models Smaller &amp; Smarter! Thrilled to share the latest technical report demonstrating how to reduce language model parameters by 77% while maintaining performance. The secret? Grouped pointwise convolutions. Yes. We brought a method from computer vision to the transformers arena. 🔑 Key Findings: • 77% parameter reduction. • Maintained model capabilities. • Improved generalization.

Physically Based Rendering, or PBR, materials play a huge role in realism. Join us the Friday to learn more. Duality.ai has been successful in using game engine simulation to create synthetic data that jumps the sim2 real gap for many commercial clients including JPL-NASA, AWS, P&amp;G, and more.

The mixture of diffusion processes is done in a way that harmonizes the generation process, preventing "seam" effects in the generated image. Using several diffusion processes in parallel has also practical advantages when generating very large images, as the GPU memory requirements are similar to that of generating an image of the size of a single tile. elismasilva/mixture-of-diffusers-sdxl-tiling See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:05:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/elismasilva/251775641926329</guid></item></channel></rss>
