Currently, ICEdit app ( RiverZ/ICEdit ) has soared to the second place on the weekly trend list of Hugging Face Space, just trailing behind Qwen3. What's more, it also holds the second position on the overall space trend list. This achievement wouldn't have been possible without your incredible support and love. A huge thank you to each and every one of you❤! 🎉 The ICEdit community has been incredibly active, and we've seen a plethora of amazing ComfyUI workflows being shared. For instance, with the help of ComfyUI - nunchaku, you can run ICEdit locally with just 4GB of VRAM. This makes it much more accessible for those with limited hardware resources. 🎇 If you're interested in the detailed information, please head over to our repository. We highly encourage you to give these workflows a try and explore the creative possibilities that ICEdit offers.

But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today. Here's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches: 1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -&gt; Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (2504.20769) Provides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs 2. Hybrid-CoT -&gt; AdaR1: From Long-CoT to Hybrid-CoT via Bi-Level Adaptive Reasoning Optimization (2504.21659) Proposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles 3.

C5 is a large-scale effort to heavily filter web-crawled data, as collected by the non-profit Common Crawl, to only documents that are Creative Commons-licensed such as cc-by-4.0 or public domain cc0. At this stage 150 billion tokens have been collected. --- 📄 data: BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons 🧰 software: https://github.com/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons --- &lt;/&gt; To build C5, HTML pages are scrutinized and all links (if any) to CC licenses are collected, both in regular hyperlinks as well as in metadata. Additional data fields are included such as "was the license found in the head ?" or "if multiple licenses were found, do they contradict each other?", which makes further filtering a breeze. 🌐 In this first version of C5, 8 languages are included (Afrikaans, German, English, French, Frysian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish). The language set was limited for two reasons: computational and storage limitations,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:26:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/BramVanroy/471518743184430</guid></item><item><title>A ton of impactful models and datasets in open AI past week, let's summarize the best 🤩</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/742287367367358</link><description>A ton of impactful models and datasets in open AI past week, let's summarize the best 🤩 merve/releases-apr-21-and-may-2-6819dcc84da4190620f448a3 💬 Qwen made it rain!

Workflows are through predefined code paths, ensuring that each step is executed in a deterministic manner. Agents are like smart assistants that can think on their own. They understand situations, make decisions, and act, whatever the task is new or unpredictable. Think of the Agent as a chef who can make a meal based on what they have. Workflows are like a recipe with fixed steps. They’re a series of tasks done in order, like following a checklist for approving a loan. They’re great for tasks that don’t change much.
