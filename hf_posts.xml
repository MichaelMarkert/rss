Also, don't comment about how unlikely this is. I've gotten a warning email about a token I 'leaked' at least four times. In all cases, it has been in the digest hash.

These models only had their text models quantized, and had a 50% model size reduction (4GB~2GB) while keeping model degradation under 1% on the DocVQA benchmark. #huggingface #smolvlm #smollm ronantakizawa/SmolVLM-Instruct-awq ronantakizawa/SmolVLM-Instruct-gptq See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 13:25:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/523357349957866</guid></item><item><title>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/611899757397292</link><description>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal embedding model, ranked first on the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark 🎉 This model is the product of quite literally months of painstaking work alongside @ abdurrahmanbutler collecting, cleaning, and processing terabytes of data as well as coming up with novel improvements to the standard embedder training recipe to push the limits of what's possible. Kanon 2 Embedder is my most advanced model to date. On MLEB, it benchmarks as 9% more accurate than OpenAI's best embedding model and 30% faster. Even when truncated from 1,792 to 768 dimensions, Kanon 2 Embedder continues to hold the number one spot on MLEB. Importantly, Kanon 2 Embedder is also privacy and security friendly — unlike Voyage, Cohere and Jina, none of your data is used to train our models by default. Kanon 2 Embedder can also be self-hosted for enterprises with heightened security or reliability requirements.

Build a production-ready weed detector under real-world constraints: small models &amp; imperfect labels—the conditions production AI teams face every day. Your mission • Detect &amp; classify 3 weed species in cotton fields: Carpetweed, Morning Glory, Palmer Amaranth • Train with YOLOv8n @ 640 (fixed model size). Tune augmentation &amp; hyperparameters, but no larger models, ensembles, or stacking allowed • Confront imperfect labels (missed weeds, class confusion, uneven boxes)—exactly what real teams face Prizes (USD $2,000 total) 🥇$1,000 • 🥈 $500• 🥉 $250 • 🎨 $250 Most Creative Solution (shareable across up to 5 teams) Plus: winner &amp; participation certificates, LinkedIn shoutouts, and community recognition. What you’ll learn • Developing AI under strict resource constraints • Data-centric techniques to detect &amp; correct label issues • Designing an iterative...</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 13:25:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/3LC/214584137705676</guid></item><item><title>New drop! 💥 The VLM Object Understanding Comparison Space now runs with Qwen3-VL-4B and moondream3.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/245018487363673</link><description>New drop! 💥 The VLM Object Understanding Comparison Space now runs with Qwen3-VL-4B and moondream3.
