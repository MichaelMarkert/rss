It‚Äôs a local AI running on my laptop with a browser extension that classifies and scrubs synthetic content from my eyeballs. I‚Äôm too old for this synthetic noise. TL;DR I‚Äôm going full John Connor on the AI content apocalypse Think of it as an on device AI ad-blocker, but for: Em-dash overdose. Seriously, why is everything suddenly revolutionary‚Äîdisruptive‚Äîlife-changing? AI influencers‚Äô auto-generated posts and images, auto-posted, all hands-free. Fake news, fake images, fake people... puff. Surprisingly, it works. I suppose it will block some human-generated content. However, I would rather read a 2007 Myspace blog than another ‚Äú10 Growth Hacks Powered By ChatGPT‚Äù post.

Fun fact: v4.0.0-rc-1 came out on Nov 19, 2020, nearly five years ago!

Knowledge needs to be constantly refreshed and updated with the latest trends. So today, we‚Äôre sharing 6 free sources to help you stay on track with RL: 1. A Survey of Continual Reinforcement Learning ‚Üí https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21872 Covers continual RL (CRL): how agents can keep learning and adapt to new tasks without forgetting past ones. It analyses methods, benchmarks, evaluation metrics &amp;challenges 2. The Deep Reinforcement Learning course by Hugging Face ‚Üí https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction This is a popular free course, regularly updated. Includes community interaction, exercises, leaderboards, etc. 3.

This work was part of a paper we published to ICCR Kyoto 2025. Check out or code here: https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot/tree/main Our work aims to solve two key problems in the world of robotic manipulation: 1. The lack of a well-developed, open-source, accessible teleoperation system that can work out of the box. 2. No performant end-to-end control, recording, and learning platform for robots that is completely hardware agnostic.

It outlines how the *Cosmic Intelligence Model (CIM)* can be mapped onto Earth, using only structural metrics and recomputation procedures.
