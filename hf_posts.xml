System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. 🚀 How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. 📊 Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% → 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% → 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% → 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. ✨ Key benefits: 🔄 Cumulative learning over time 📖 Transparent, inspectable strategies 🔌 Works with any OpenAI-compatible API ⚡ Simple integration: just add "spl-" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm. After 500 queries, our system developed 129 strategies and refined 97 of them! This feels like a genuine step toward AI that learns...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:24:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200</guid></item><item><title>Hey!

I'd love to hear ideas from more advanced players about how I could improve this. My vision for this project was to improve pattern recognition of openings, tactics, and positions through artificial synesthesia. Please try it out and let me know if you have any ideas for it: maximuspowers/musical-chess Thanks😁 See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:24:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/maximuspowers/979692979265259</guid></item><item><title>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 80+ ⭐️ now!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/546324156600139</link><description>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 80+ ⭐️ now!
