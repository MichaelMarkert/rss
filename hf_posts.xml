Qwen-Image, a 20B MMDiT model for next-generation text-to-image generation, preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. It is especially strong at creating stunning graphic posters with native text. The model is now open-source.

The model supports a wide range of vision-related tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and image super-resolution. While each task is technically distinct, they can all be viewed...</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 05:32:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/372876915549424</guid></item><item><title>I run Claude Code with Qwen3 Coder Flash locally on my MacBook Air.

It works offline, zero cloud, zero internet, zero EU AI Act anxiety. No limit with all tokens on the house. It’s not great, not terrible- adequate performance for an on device AI agent chewing through code on a 1.24 kg laptop. I wrote an interpreter to broker peace between Claude Code and my local AI runtime. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it’s aligned with the company that owns it.
