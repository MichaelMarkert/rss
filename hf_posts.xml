Agents, workflows, context management and many other aspects are reshaping how software gets built. We’ve collected a set of resources to help you understand how AI coding is evolving today and what building strategies work best: 1. AI Agentic Programming: A Survey of Techniques, Challenges, and Opportunities (2508.11126) Provides a clear taxonomy, compares agent architectures, and exposes practical gaps in tools, benchmarks, and reliability that AI coding agents now struggle with 2. Does AI-Assisted Coding Deliver? A Difference-in-Differences Study of Cursor's Impact on Software Projects (2511.04427) This survey from Carnegie Mellon University shows causal evidence that LLM agent assistants deliver short-term productivity gains but have lasting quality costs that can slow development over time 3. A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models (2510.12399) Turns...</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 09:31:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/300455492795256</guid></item><item><title>NVIDIA releases Nemotron 3 Nano, a new 30B hybrid reasoning model! 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/963278821580490</link><description>NVIDIA releases Nemotron 3 Nano, a new 30B hybrid reasoning model! 🔥 Has 1M context window &amp; best in class performance for SWE-Bench, reasoning &amp; chat.

We’re excited to introduce VideoCoF, a unified framework for instruction-based video editing that enables temporal reasoning and ~4× video length extrapolation, trained with only 50k video pairs. 🔥 🔍 What makes VideoCoF different? 🧠 Chain-of-Frames reasoning , mimic human thinking process like Seeing → Reasoning → Editing to apply edits accurately over time without external masks, ensuring physically plausible results. 📈 Strong length generalization — trained on 33-frame clips, yet supports multi-shot editing and long-video extrapolation (~4×). 🎯 Unified fine-grained editing — Object Removal, Addition, Swap, and Local Style Transfer, with instance-level &amp; part-level, spatial-aware control. ⚡ Fast inference update 🚀 H100: ~20s / video with 4-step inference, making high-quality video editing far more practical for real-world use. 🔗 Links 📄 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07469 💻 Code:...</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 09:31:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sanaka87/963485970840656</guid></item><item><title>📢 For those who interested in applying LLM for inferring iterators of data with CoT / prompts, this update might be relevant.

A new paper reports it's also a huge privacy risk. That's why we're excited to see the "SafeKV" paper from researchers at the University of Connecticut, Peking University, and others. Their solution-oriented framework selectively shares non-sensitive data while isolating PII. To validate the "Safe" part of their system, they needed a robust, multilingual privacy benchmark. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy pii-masking dataset was used for this critical evaluation related to privacy. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data enables researchers to build and validate more effective security solutions for core AI infrastructure. Their work, in turn, helps make the entire LLM ecosystem safer, showing that performance and privacy don't have to be mutually exclusive.

At first I used this story to amuse fellow MLOps guys, but then I went deeper and was surprised. To those who don't want to read too much, in plain English: when you give the model a high-stakes statement that clashes with what it "knows" about the world, it gets more brittle. Sometimes to a point of being unusable. Or an even shorter version: do not clash with the model's given worldview—it will degrade to some extent. And in practice, it means that in lower-resource languages like Latvian and Finnish (and probably others), Flash 2.5 is an unreliable guardrail model when something clashes with the model's general "worldview". However, I'm sure this degradation applies to other languages and models as well to varying extents. In one totally normal week of MLOps, my news summarization pipeline started...</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 09:31:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/martinsu/283521322948177</guid></item><item><title>🐦‍🔥 I've just published Sentence Transformers v5.2.0!

It introduces multi-processing for CrossEncoder (rerankers), multilingual NanoBEIR evaluators, similarity score outputs in mine_hard_negatives, Transformers v5 support and more. Details: - CrossEncoder multi-processing: Similar to SentenceTransformer and SparseEncoder, you can now use multi-processing with CrossEncoder rerankers. Useful for multi-GPU and CPU settings, and simple to configure: just device=["cuda:0", "cuda:1"] or device=["cpu"]*4 on the model.predict or model.rank calls. - Multilingual NanoBEIR Support: You can now use community translations of the tiny NanoBEIR retrieval benchmark instead of only the English one, by passing dataset_id , e.g. dataset_id="lightonai/NanoBEIR-de" for the German benchmark. - Similarity scores in Hard Negatives Mining: When mining for hard negatives to create a strong training dataset, you can now pass output_scores=True to get similarity scores returned. This can be useful for some...</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 09:31:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/853653818134091</guid></item></channel></rss>
