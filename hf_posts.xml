It was never fine-tuned or even shown a single MMLU question during training.Yet here are the zero-shot MMLU (57 subjects) results:Model MMLU Zero-Shot Training Data AetherMind_SRL (me) 184M 36.05 % Only NLI (SNLI/MNLI/ANLI + ADNI) DeBERTa-v3-base 278M ~30.8 % General pre-training BERT-large 340M 27–30 % General pre-training LLaMA-1 7B 7B 34–35 % Massive text corpus LLaMA-2 7B 7B ~45 % Bigger + better data Yes – my 184M model beats every classic 300–400M model and the original 7-billion-parameter LLaMA-1, all while running at 300+ samples/sec on a $300 laptop GPU.How did this happen?I built a standardized self-improvement loop called AetherMind Self-Reflective Learning (SRL)...</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/506428935925502</guid></item><item><title>When models get too large for a single GPU, simply stacking layers vertically (Pipeline Parallelism) isn't always the answer.

Sometimes, you need to slice the matrices themselves. My latest guide breaks down the hardware mechanics of Tensor Parallelism (TP). We look at how to shard individual operations across devices to make a cluster function as one massive accelerator. This isn't high-level theory—it is a look at the bare metal implementation. Here is what is covered in the deep dive: The Strategies: Column vs. Row Parallelism We analyze how to split weight matrices (W) and inputs (X). Column-Linear: Splits weights by columns. Requires an All-Gather to reconstruct the output. Row-Linear: Splits weights by rows. Requires an All-Reduce to sum partial results. The "Megatron-LM" Optimization Efficiency comes from minimizing communication. By sandwiching the non-linearity (GeLU) between a Column-Parallel layer and a Row-Parallel layer, we can skip synchronization entirely during the...</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/flozi00/715911271022864</guid></item><item><title>FLUX 2 vs FLUX SRPO, New FLUX Training Kohya SS GUI Premium App With Presets &amp; Features :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/938257136422472</link><description>FLUX 2 vs FLUX SRPO, New FLUX Training Kohya SS GUI Premium App With Presets &amp; Features : https://youtu.be/RQHmyJVOHXo FLUX 2 has been published and I have compared it to the very best FLUX base model known as FLUX SRPO.

Anthropic found 98.7% context savings using code execution with MCP, Cloudflare published similar findings. This is my open-source implementation of the same idea. # The Problem Traditional MCP exposes every tool definition directly to the model. With 12 tools, that's thousands of tokens consumed *before the conversation even starts*. Each tool call also passes intermediate results through the context window — a 10,000-row spreadsheet? That's all going into context just to sum a column. # The Solution: One Tool to Rule Them All Agent_Terminal wraps all 12 tools ( Web_Search , Web_Fetch , File_System , Generate_Image , Generate_Speech , Generate_Video , Deep_Research , Memory_Manager , Obsidian_Vault , Shell_Command , Code_Interpreter ) into a single Python code execution gateway. Instead of the model making individual tool calls, it writes...</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Nymbo/982136402285178</guid></item><item><title>Accidentally made a totally blank, non-functioning HF Space while poking “what does this do” buttons without reading anything.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Babsie/682016122905240</link><description>Accidentally made a totally blank, non-functioning HF Space while poking “what does this do” buttons without reading anything.
