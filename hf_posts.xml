To make a research survey, you generally follow two steps, preparation (collect and organize papers) and writing (outline creation, writing, polishing). Researchers followed the same two steps and automated them. 🎯 For the preparation part, a key part is find all the important references on the given subject. Researchers first cast a wide net of all relevant papers. But then finding the really important ones is like distilling knowledge from a haystack of information. To solve this challenge, they built an “AttributeTree” object that structures key information from citations. Ablating these AttributeTrees significantly decreased structure and...</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:22:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/788543954757847</guid></item><item><title>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</link><description>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2, with a single-label classification problem type! 🌀🧤 - AI vs Deepfake vs Real : prithivMLmods/AI-vs-Deepfake-vs-Real-Siglip2 - Deepfake Detect : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Detect-Siglip2 - Fire Detection : prithivMLmods/Fire-Detection-Siglip2 - Deepfake Quality Assess : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Quality-Assess-Siglip2 - Guard Against Unsafe Content : prithivMLmods/Guard-Against-Unsafe-Content-Siglip2 🌠Collection : prithivMLmods/siglip2-custom-67bcdb2de8fe96b99fb4e19e See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:22:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Just launched: A toolkit of 20 powerful AI tools that journalists can use right now - transcribe, analyze, create. 100% free &amp; open-source.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/982146976081521</link><description>🚀 Just launched: A toolkit of 20 powerful AI tools that journalists can use right now - transcribe, analyze, create. 100% free &amp; open-source. Been testing all these tools myself and created a searchable collection of the most practical ones - from audio transcription to image generation to document analysis. No coding needed, no expensive subscriptions. Some highlights I've tested personally: - Private, on-device transcription with speaker ID in 100+ languages using Whisper - Website scraping that just works - paste a URL, get structured data - Local image editing with tools like Finegrain (impressive results) - Document chat using Qwen 2.5 72B (handles technical papers well) Sharing this early because the best tools come from the community.
