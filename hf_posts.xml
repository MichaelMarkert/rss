In my latest blog post, I explore why these traditional consent models are increasingly problematic in the age of generative AI. I found three fundamental challenges: - Scope problem: how can you know what you're agreeing to when AI could use your data in different ways? - Temporality problem: once an AI system learns from your data, good luck trying to make it "unlearn" it. - Autonomy trap: the data you share today could create systems that pigeonhole you tomorrow. Individual users shouldn't bear all the responsibility, while big tech holds all the cards. We need better approaches to level the playing field, from collective advocacy and stronger technological safeguards to establishing "data fiduciaries" with a legal duty to protect our digital interests.

I also prove that finetuning on your domain helps much more than you might think. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Reranker Training Refactor Reranker models can now be trained using an extensive trainer with a lot of powerful features: - MultiGPU Training (Data Parallelism (DP) and Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP)) - bf16 training support; loss logging - Evaluation datasets + evaluation loss - Improved callback support + an excellent Weights &amp; Biases integration - Gradient checkpointing, gradient accumulation - Model card generation - Resuming from a training checkpoint without performance loss - Hyperparameter Optimization and much more!
