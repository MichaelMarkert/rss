The field isn‚Äôt standing still ‚Äì new LoRA variants push the limits of efficiency, generalization, and personalization. So we‚Äôre sharing 10 of the latest LoRA approaches you should know about: 1. Mixture-of-LoRA-experts ‚Üí Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts in Generalizable Audio Deepfake Detection (2509.13878) Adds multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into a model‚Äôs layers, and a routing mechanism activates the most suitable ones for each input. This lets the model adapt better to new unseen conditions 2. Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL) ‚Üí Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (2508.14285) Balances global and task-specific parameters within a Bayesian framework to improve uncertainty calibration and generalization to new tasks without high...</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:17:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/445000542637232</guid></item><item><title>Discussing  iMini Nano Banana ‚Äì Practical AI Templates for Creative Workflows</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ethank01/541492789102968</link><description>Discussing iMini Nano Banana ‚Äì Practical AI Templates for Creative Workflows üéôÔ∏èI‚Äôve been experimenting with imini nano banana recently, and the new batch of 100+ AI templates feels like a real shift in how we handle creative workflows. üé®One example: the photo-to-hand-drawn sketch template. I tested it with a travel photo (a blonde girl in front of the Eiffel Tower) ‚Üí the output was a clean, consistent hand-drawn sketch in seconds. Normally, this would take manual editing in Photoshop/Illustrator, but the AI template cut the process down to a single click. üí°From a workflow perspective, this could streamline tasks for: Designers: quick iterations on style variations Marketers: generating campaign visuals at scale Content creators: producing unique artwork without advanced editing skills üñåÔ∏èIf anyone here has tested imini nano banana in professional projects, I‚Äôd like to hear how it fits into your pipeline.

Causal Reasoning. Model based eval frameworks can't tell you if your changes actually improved user outcomes - you need to take a systems level approach. At Remyx, we‚Äôre building the intelligence layer for AI experimentation. Check out this example on how we start laying the scaffolding to launch controlled experiments to turn your hypotheses into insights on what drives performance for your application.

When you ask a question with positive framing, you get positive answers. Ask with negative framing, you get negative answers. The AI becomes a mirror of your own assumptions. Your framing determines the answer - The same topic yields opposite responses based on how you ask AIs amplify your sentiment - Negative questions often get even MORE negative responses This affects everyone - From students doing research to professionals making decisions Why This Matters This isn't a technical glitch - it's fundamental to how these systems work. They're trained on human language, and humans frame things with bias. The AI learned to match that framing.

By limiting submissions to only freshly published code, we could evaluate based on consistency over time with rolling averages instead of finding agents overfit to a static benchmark. Can rolling benchmarks bring us closer to evaluating agents in a way more closely aligned with their real-world applications? Perhaps a new direction for agent evaluation? Would love to hear what you think about this!
