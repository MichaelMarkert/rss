We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!

MalayLM is also attractive for organizations wishing to preserve data privacy as it s efficiency allows it to run on a local machine. 🧠 MamayLM is trained on high-quality Ukrainian data and understands Ukrainian language, culture, and history. It is built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 9B model, but uses a number of new advances stemming from INSAIT’s experience in creating BgGPT, a Bulgarian LLM we released last year, now adopted nationwide and profiled several times by Google as a worldwide success case. 🤝 MamayLM is developed in a...</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:20:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hannayukhymenko/367157502110648</guid></item><item><title>SkyReels-V2 INFINITE VIDEO🔥♾️🎬 UNLIMITED duration video generation model  by Skywork.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/luigi12345/382493254979768</link><description>SkyReels-V2 INFINITE VIDEO🔥♾️🎬 UNLIMITED duration video generation model by Skywork. &gt; “Finally is here.

Lastly, they also release a new benchmark again with self-supervision, they use an LLM to evaluate the detailed captions focusing on localization 👏 See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:20:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/338904780470677</guid></item><item><title>New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/857345172218118</link><description>New reasoning algo just dropped: Adaptive Parallel Reasoning “we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end.
