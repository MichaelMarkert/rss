We've worked to integrate the three frameworks in distinctive ways so that learners can reflect on when and where to use each. This also means that you can follow the course if you're already familiar with one of these frameworks, and soak up some of the fundamental knowledge in earlier units. Hopefully, this makes the agents course as open to as many people as possible.

Kennedy. Raw zlatinb/jfk-2025-raw Cleaned zlatinb/jfk-2025-cleaned The 2182 documents cover a vast range of topics, so it may be interesting to train on them to generate insights.

Context: AlexNet had a historic win in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), reducing error rate from 26% (previous best) to 15.3%. It‚Äôs a deep CNN with 8 layers (5 convolutional + 3 fully connected), pioneering the use of ReLU activations for faster training, dropout for regularization, and GPU acceleration for large-scale learning. This moment marked the beginning of the deep learning revolution, inspiring architectures like VGG, ResNet, and modern transformers.
