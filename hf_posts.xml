Model now shows step-by-step thinking in &lt;think&gt; tags before answering. Logic puzzle accuracy: 61% → 84%. 3 hours training on single GPU. 🧠 Used GRPO where model generates multiple responses and learns to prefer better reasoning. Works surprisingly well for making smaller models more transparent. 🔗 Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/codelion/ellora/blob/main/Ellora_Recipe_2_Reasoning_LoRA_with_Self-Rewarding_GRPO.ipynb 🤗 Model: codelion/gemma-3-1b-it-reasoning-grpo-lora 💻 Code: https://github.com/codelion/ellora See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:19:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/968650774475150</guid></item><item><title>I wanted to share a technique that's been working really well for recovering performance after INT4 quantization.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/741062673202173</link><description>I wanted to share a technique that's been working really well for recovering performance after INT4 quantization. Typically, quantizing the LLM to INT4 (unlike say INT8) for inference can incur some accuracy loss. Instead of accepting the quality loss, we used the FP16 model as a teacher to train a tiny LoRA adapter (rank=16) for the quantized model. The cool part: the model generates its own training data using the Magpie technique so no external datasets needed. This is critical because we want to remain as much as possible in the distribution of the model's natural responses. Last year Apple's foundational models paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075 ) had proposed a similar technique and found "By using accuracy-recovery LoRA adapters with only rank 16, Alpaca win rate can be improved by 7-18%, GMS8K accuracy is boosted by 5-10%." (page 47). We saw similar results on Qwen3-0.6B: Perplexity: 2.40 → 2.09 (only 5.7% degradation from FP16 baseline) Memory: Only 0.28GB vs 1.0GB...</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:19:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/741062673202173</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/809439997973106</link><description>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On! 🚀 Now Live and Free to Use!Say goodbye to online shopping uncertainty - "Will this look good on me?" - with our revolutionary solution!Fashion Fit 360 is a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual fitting service that transforms your fashion shopping experience.

Next week, we'll be at the AI Agent Builders Summit. And in late October, GitHub Universe, ODSC West, and Experiment 2025. We're sharing what we've learned while building agents to help you test new research ideas out of the arXiv into PRs for your repo. This Summer, we've analyzed thousands of papers, ranking each for relevance to our work before building hundreds of Docker images and opening hundreds of PRs for our repos.
