TL;DR: With MCP (Model Context Protocol), you can expose tools like web search or image generation and connect them directly to LLMs. It’s simple — and surprisingly powerful. pip install "huggingface_hub[mcp]&gt;=0.32.0" We wrote a blog post where we show how to run Tiny Agents, and dive deeper into how they work and how to build your own. 👉 https://huggingface.co/blog/python-tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 05:21:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/celinah/946156020996069</guid></item><item><title>🎉🥳 SOTA!!! 🚀👑</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/484907766797591</link><description>🎉🥳 SOTA!!! 🚀👑 🥇 Claude 4 Opus !!🥇 7 months!! ⌛⌛ I thought the day would never come.

Just released **OpenEvolve** - an open-source implementation of Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve system. It's an evolutionary coding agent that uses LLMs to discover and optimize algorithms. I successfully replicated DeepMind's results on circle packing (99.97% match!) and evolved a random search into a simulated annealing algorithm. ✨ Key features: - Evolves entire codebases (not just single functions) - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API - LLM ensemble approach for better results - Multi-objective optimization 👉 Check it out: GitHub: https://github.com/codelion/openevolve Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/openevolve Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about it!
