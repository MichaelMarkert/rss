As we close this chapter, we're laying the groundwork for a more modular and community-driven future: - Optimum v2: A lightweight core package for porting Transformers, Diffusers, or Sentence-Transformers to specialized AI hardware/software/accelerators.. - Optimum‑ONNX: A dedicated package where the ONNX/ONNX Runtime ecosystem lives and evolves, faster-moving and decoupled from the Optimum core. 🎯 Why this matters: - A clearer governance path for ONNX, fostering stronger community collaboration and improved developer experience.. - Enable innovation at a faster pace in a more modular, open-source environment. 💡 What this means: - More transparency, broader participation, and faster development driven by the community and key actors in the ONNX ecosystem (PyTorch, Microsoft, Joshua Lochner 👀, ...) - A cleaner, more maintainable core Optimum, focused on extending HF libraries to special AI...</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/721004690541036</guid></item><item><title>We've crossed 1 million repositories backed by Xet storage on Hugging Face! 🚀🚀🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/651298897017923</link><description>We've crossed 1 million repositories backed by Xet storage on Hugging Face! 🚀🚀🚀 You can follow along our progress converting the Hub from Git LFS to Xet at jsulz/ready-xet-go We have a lot of repos left to migrate, which means I have plenty of time to add more animations 🤪 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/651298897017923</guid></item><item><title>Qwen just released Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 🔥 an upgrade to the non-thinking mode model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/246049488455702</link><description>Qwen just released Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 🔥 an upgrade to the non-thinking mode model Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 ✨ 30B MoE / 3.3B active - Apache 2.0 ✨ Strong gains in reasoning, math, coding, &amp; multilingual tasks ✨ Native support for 256K long-context inputs See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/246049488455702</guid></item><item><title>When you're looking for data, what's your focus (use the reactions below to vote):</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/147929225613950</link><description>When you're looking for data, what's your focus (use the reactions below to vote): 🚀 Getting as many images as you can 🤯 Getting the right type of images (framing, domain, lighting, etc) I know both are very important, but I'm curious what people would put as #1 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/147929225613950</guid></item><item><title>We just released TRL v0.20 with major multimodal upgrades!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/236970560808195</link><description>We just released TRL v0.20 with major multimodal upgrades! 👁️ VLM support for GRPO (highly requested by the community!) 🎞️ New GSPO trainer (from @ Qwen , released last week, VLM-ready) 🐙 New MPO trainer (multimodal by design, as in the paper) 📝 Full release notes here: https://github.com/huggingface/trl/releases/tag/v0.20.0 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/236970560808195</guid></item><item><title>☀️ Build a Website Chatbot in Minutes—No Fine-Tuning Required!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dmoxy/897711395009147</link><description>☀️ Build a Website Chatbot in Minutes—No Fine-Tuning Required!
