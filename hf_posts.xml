One of the most requested models I've seen, The Johns Hopkins University's CLSP has trained state-of-the-art massively multilingual encoders using the ModernBERT architecture: mmBERT. Model details: - 2 model sizes: - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base - Uses the ModernBERT architecture, but with the Gemma2 multilingual tokenizer (so: flash attention, alternating global/local attention, unpadding/sequence packing, etc.) - Maximum sequence length of 8192 tokens, on the high end for encoders - Trained on 1833 languages using DCLM, FineWeb2, and many more sources - 3 training phases: 2.3T tokens pretraining on 60 languages, 600B tokens mid-training on 110 languages, and 100B tokens decay training on all 1833 languages. - Both models are MIT Licensed, and the full datasets and intermediary checkpoints are also publicly released Evaluation details: - Very competitive with ModernBERT at equivalent sizes on English (GLUE, MTEB v2 English after...</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:22:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/906557413568289</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Ever dreamed of training your own Large Language Model from scratch?

What if I told you it doesn't require a supercomputer or PhD in ML? 🤯 Introducing LLM Trainer - the educational framework that makes LLM training accessible to EVERYONE! Whether you're on a CPU-only laptop or scaling to distributed GPUs, we've got you covered. 💻➡️🖥️ Why LLM Trainer? Because existing tools are either too simplistic (hiding the magic) or too complex (requiring expert knowledge). We bridge the gap with: 🎓 Educational transparency - every component built from scratch with clear code 💻 CPU-first approach - start training immediately, no GPU needed 🔧 Full customization - modify anything you want 📈 Seamless scaling - from laptop to cluster without code changes 🤝 HuggingFace integration - works with existing models &amp; tokenizers Key highlights: ✅ Built-in tokenizers (BPE, WordPiece, HF wrappers) ✅ Complete Transformer implementation from scratch ✅ Optimized for CPU training ✅ Advanced features: mixed...</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:22:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/356298508659280</guid></item><item><title>Hunyuan Image 2.1 by Tencent Full Tutorial and 1-Click to Install Ultra Advanced App to Use Locally :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/330916531424120</link><description>Hunyuan Image 2.1 by Tencent Full Tutorial and 1-Click to Install Ultra Advanced App to Use Locally : https://youtu.be/dNeA5mJ36hA Tutorial video : https://youtu.be/dNeA5mJ36hA Check the below screenshots Hunyuan Image 2.1 just published by Tencent and I have been working on developing the very best app to let you use HunyuanImage-2.1 with easiest and most accurate way. In this tutorial video, I will show you how to literally 1-click to install this model and our app on Windows (locally), Massed Compute (cloud) and RunPod (cloud).

In short, the smol course is just more direct that any of the other course, and intended for semi-pro post trainers. - It’s a minimal set of instructions on the core parts. - It’s intended to bootstrap real projects you're working on. - The material handsover to existing documentation for details - Likewise, it handsover to the LLM course for basics. - Assessment is based on a leaderboard, without reading all the material.

We've developed an agent to automate the environment building and testing of experimental codebases sourced from arXiv. We push these containerized reproductions daily to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/remyxai However, searching for them can be challenging unless you know the specific arXiv ID associated with each paper. We are currently working on implementing a search feature in Remyx, which will make these assets easily discoverable and ready for testing 🔍 Stay tuned!
