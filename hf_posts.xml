In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. 📤 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt; are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is &lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|user|&gt;. 📏 Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 17:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752</guid></item><item><title>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/evalstate/865812476358807</link><description>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New!

Chayan just submitted to the RouterArena leaderboard and achieved 69.05% accuracy on the benchmark! 🔗 Model: adaptive-classifier/chayan 🔗 Dataset: RouteWorks/RouterArena 📊 Performance Highlights Chayan achieves impressive results on the RouterArena benchmark: • 69.05% accuracy (would rank #1 on current leaderboard) • $0.333 per 1K queries • +12.07pp improvement over all-mini baseline (56.98%) • 99% of perfect 2-model oracle performance at 57% lower cost Compared to our previous 2-model router (61.43% accuracy), Chayan delivers +7.62pp improvement through smarter 4-model routing. 🧠 How It Works Chayan uses an Adaptive K-NN classifier with prototype memory to route between 4 models: • openai/gpt-4o-mini (fast &amp; cheap) •...</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 17:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/349113167339666</guid></item><item><title>I built a demo on how to implement Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) in an LLM and compare its performance gains to RAG (111 stars, 20 forks).</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/762624768908636</link><description>I built a demo on how to implement Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) in an LLM and compare its performance gains to RAG (111 stars, 20 forks). https://github.com/ronantakizawa/cacheaugmentedgeneration CAG preloads document content into an LLM’s context as a precomputed key-value (KV) cache. This caching eliminates the need for real-time retrieval during inference, reducing token usage by up to 76% while maintaining answer quality. CAG is particularly effective for constrained knowledge bases like internal documentation, FAQs, and customer support systems, where all relevant information can fit within the model's extended context window. #rag #retrievalaugmentedgeneration See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 17:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/762624768908636</guid></item><item><title>The reaction on the QAT post is beyond expectations so below is my optimizer post as promised.
