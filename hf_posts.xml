Given a financial event, it provides explained predictions based on a dataset of past news and central bank speeches. Try it out here: SelmaNajih001/StockPredictionExplanation (Just restart the space and wait a minute) The dataset used for RAG can be found here: SelmaNajih001/FinancialNewsAndCentralBanksSpeeches-Summary-Rag While the dataset used for the training is: SelmaNajih001/FinancialClassification I also wrote an article to explain how I've done the training.

Some of its directions are already showing huge promise, while others are still early but exciting. Here’s a look at what’s happening right now in RL: 1. Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) → Reinforcement Pre-Training (2506.08007) Reframes next-token pretraining as RL with verifiable rewards, yielding scalable reasoning gains 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) → Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences (1706.03741) The top approach. It trains a model using human preference feedback, building a reward model and then optimizing the policy to generate outputs people prefer 3. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) → Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs (2506.14245) Moves from subjective (human-labeled) rewards to objective ones that can be automatically verified, like in...</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 09:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/610901061800000</guid></item><item><title>🚀 New blog: Maintain the unmaintainable – 1M+ Python LOC, 400+ models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Molbap/149398104991391</link><description>🚀 New blog: Maintain the unmaintainable – 1M+ Python LOC, 400+ models How do you stop a million-line library built by thousands of contributors from collapsing under its own weight? At 🤗 Transformers, we do it with explicit software-engineering tenets, principles that make the codebase hackable at scale. 🔍 Inside the post: – One Model, One File: readability first — you can still open a modeling file and see the full logic, top to bottom. – Modular Transformers: visible inheritance that cuts maintenance cost by ~15× while keeping models readable. – Config-Driven Performance: FlashAttention, tensor parallelism, and attention scheduling are config-level features, not rewrites. Written with @ lysandre ,@pcuenq and @ yonigozlan , this is a deep dive into how Transformers stays fast, open, and maintainable.

My co-author @ cgeorgiaw and I just published a paper challenging a core assumption: that the main barriers to AI in science are technical. They're not. They're social. Key findings: 🚨 The "AI Scientist" myth delays progress: Waiting for AGI devalues human expertise and obscures science's real purpose: cultivating understanding, not just outputs. 📊 Wrong incentives: Datasets have 100x longer impact than models, yet data curation is undervalued. ⚠️ Broken collaboration: Domain scientists want understanding. ML researchers optimize performance. Without shared language, projects fail. 🔍 Fragmentation costs years: Harmonizing just 9 cancer files took 329 hours. Why this matters: Upstream bottlenecks like efficient PDE solvers could accelerate discovery across multiple sciences. CASP mobilized a community around protein structure, enabling AlphaFold. We need this for dozens of challenges. Thus, we're launching...</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 09:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/evijit/733521758778057</guid></item><item><title>Sora 2 invitation code, share your Sora 2 invitation code!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/404Zen/898612621867670</link><description>Sora 2 invitation code, share your Sora 2 invitation code!
