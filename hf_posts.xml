When you ask a question with positive framing, you get positive answers. Ask with negative framing, you get negative answers. The AI becomes a mirror of your own assumptions. Your framing determines the answer - The same topic yields opposite responses based on how you ask AIs amplify your sentiment - Negative questions often get even MORE negative responses This affects everyone - From students doing research to professionals making decisions Why This Matters This isn't a technical glitch - it's fundamental to how these systems work. They're trained on human language, and humans frame things with bias. The AI learned to match that framing. Think about the implications: - Medical professionals seeking second opinions - Students researching controversial topics - Business leaders evaluating strategies - Anyone using AI for important decisions The Stochastic Mirror Effect Let's call this...</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 09:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Tanaybh/360553614352968</guid></item><item><title>Just released a preview of Moondream 3!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/vikhyatk/428307575853218</link><description>Just released a preview of Moondream 3! moondream/moondream3-preview This is a 9B parameter, 2B active MoE VLM with state of the art visual reasoning capabilities.

I uploaded a single photo of my corgi, and within minutes, it generated a detailed 3D figurine model. What makes this really interesting for tech and design folks: AI-powered 2D ‚Üí 3D conversion (no manual modeling required) Preserves character consistency even with multiple images Export options for 3D printing or digital use (OBJ, FBX, STL) Works with pets, people, and even illustrated characters For anyone into 3D modeling, collectibles, or architecture visualization, this is a game-changer. Imagine transforming static photos into tangible 3D assets with just a few clicks. Here‚Äôs the link if you want to try it out: https://imini.com/nano-banana Has anyone else here tested Nano Banana for pets or other personal projects? Would love to hear your results!

Causal Reasoning. Model based eval frameworks can't tell you if your changes actually improved user outcomes - you need to take a systems level approach. At Remyx, we‚Äôre building the intelligence layer for AI experimentation. Check out this example on how we start laying the scaffolding to launch controlled experiments to turn your hypotheses into insights on what drives performance for your application.

For papers that include code, setting up the right environment often means hours of dependency hell and configuration debugging. At Remyx AI, we built an agent that automatically creates and tests Docker images for research papers, then shares them publicly so anyone can reproduce results with a single command. We just submitted PR #908 to integrate this directly into arXiv Labs. If you believe in making reproducible research accessible to everyone, give it a bump!: https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-browse/pull/908 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 09:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/494327094243098</guid></item><item><title>Announcing our new work on "Repository Level Question Answering"! üéâ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/735409135497339</link><description>Announcing our new work on "Repository Level Question Answering"! üéâ We introduce SWE-QA, a repository-level code QA benchmark with 576 real-world questions that require a deep understanding of the entire codebase to answer.
