The transformer architecture is cursed by its computational complexity. It is why you run out of tokens and have to compact. But some would argue that this is a feature not a bug and that this is also why these models are so good. We've been doing a lot of research on trying to make equally good models that are computationally cheaper, But so far, none of the approaches have stood the test of time. Or so it seems. Please vote, don't be shy. Remember that the Dunning-Kruger effect is very real, so the person who knows less about transformers than you is going to vote. We want everyone's opinion, no matter confidence. 👍 if you think at least one frontier model* will have no O(n^2) attention by the end of 2026 🔥 If you disagree * Frontier models - models that match / outperform the flagship claude, gemini or chatgpt at the time on multiple popular benchmarks See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/marksverdhei/554043140037847</guid></item><item><title>SeedVR2 and FlashVSR+ Studio Level Image and Video Upscaler Pro Released</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/552992030098244</link><description>SeedVR2 and FlashVSR+ Studio Level Image and Video Upscaler Pro Released Tutorial video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPWsg8DREiM 📂 Resources &amp; Links: 💻 SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro Download Link : [ https://www.patreon.com/posts/Upscaler-Studio-Pro-150202809 ] 🚆 Requirements Tutorial : https://youtu.be/DrhUHnYfwC0 🛠️ Requirements Written Post : [ https://www.patreon.com/posts/Windows-AI-Requirements-Setup-Guide-111553210 ] 👋 SECourses Discord Channel for 7/24 Support: [ https://bit.ly/SECoursesDiscord ] It has been long waited to have a studio level video and image upscaler app. Today we have publishing the version 1.0 of SECourses Ultimate Video and Image Upscaler Pro.

A new step-by-step guide shows that the answer is a resounding "yes." While powerful, large language models aren't specialized for privacy tasks. This tutorial by Analytics Vidhya walks through how to fine-tune Gemini into a dedicated tool for PII anonymization. To teach the model this critical skill, the author needed a robust dataset with thousands of clear 'before' and 'after' examples. We're thrilled they chose the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset for this task. Our data provided the high-quality, paired examples of masked and unmasked text necessary to effectively train Gemini to identify and hide sensitive information accurately. This is a perfect example of how the community can use open-source data to add a crucial layer of safety to the world's most powerful models. Great work! 🔗 Check out the full tutorial here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/03/guide-to-fine-tuning-gemini-for-masking-pii-...</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/800845216560901</guid></item><item><title>test</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/paasthaamz/730113013208944</link><description>test</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/paasthaamz/730113013208944</guid></item><item><title>Now with extra functionality at the same LTX-2 HF Space, you can now add also your last frame along side your first frame to guide the generated videos by choosing our frame interpolation mode...</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/alexnasa/577067311800070</link><description>Now with extra functionality at the same LTX-2 HF Space, you can now add also your last frame along side your first frame to guide the generated videos by choosing our frame interpolation mode...

That’s why everything in Voiden is a Block, the smallest, most flexible piece of your API world. Your endpoints, headers, query params, JSON bodies, even file attachments, all are individual Blocks you can add, remove, reorder, and reuse. Think of it as LEGO for HTTP: snap together Blocks to build clean, modular API requests that are easy to read, maintain, and share. But it gets better. With Reusable Blocks, you create a Block once and import it everywhere you need it, just like importing functions in your code. Update the Block once, and changes ripple through all your requests automatically. Why this matters: - Save time &amp; energy, no more repeating the same thing over and over - Stay consistent, headers, params, and auth always match across your projects - Keep your workspace clean &amp; focused, add only the Blocks you need - Collaborate...</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/610200840727549</guid></item><item><title>LoongFlow Big News!!!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/FreshmanD/759883646504275</link><description>LoongFlow Big News!!! @ all We’ve put AI Agents into a production GPU cluster to handle GPU failure prediction. Not as a demo. Not as AutoML. But as an evolving system that designs and improves its own models. On two GPU types: – IT21HMDB01-B2: +30% prediction accuracy – H800: +25% prediction accuracy The resulting models already meet production standards and are being wired into the ops pipeline. How it works: • An ML agent designs the full ML pipeline from scratch • A Math agent performs targeted evolutionary optimization • The agents explore, discard, and iterate toward better modelsHumans don’t hand-tune parameters. This is not offline analysis. GPU failure prediction means: • heavy assets • real incidents • real operational risk The agents now trigger maintenance before failures happen. This feels like an early signal: AI agents are starting to take responsibility for infrastructure-level engineering decisions in production systems. For ML Agent, you can check:...</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/FreshmanD/759883646504275</guid></item><item><title>Introducing FLUX.2-Klein-LoRA-Studio, a demo for image editing using specialized LoRA adapters built for the FLUX.2-Klein-Distilled model.
