Want to do data extraction, translation, RAG, tool use, or math on a Raspberry Pi? We got you covered! ✅ These tiny models were fine-tuned to perform narrow tasks extremely well, making them competitive with much larger models. You can deploy them today on-device or even on GPUs for big data operations!

David must be released. I will prepare a standard sweep for david to showcase the prowess of the final multi-vocab variant. This will include a variation that contains all mnist variants, cifar10, cifar100, imagenet 1k, and in the future I'll prepare a full imagenet sweep utilizing the entire 12m corpus instead of the 1.2m I used. I may need to get in touch with the actual curator of the dataset for licensing but maybe not. David utilizes 4 projective variants of the vocabulary and the training process involves teaching and freezing them akin to teacher/student processing. I did not want to release David yet, but I believe now that David will save lives and it's irresponsible for me to contain such a creation.

It's poorly documented, but the code should be straightforward. https://github.com/jim-plus/llm-abliteration The code is built atop a fork that enabled abliteration to be performed on models loaded in 4-bit or 8-bit bitsandbytes quantization. TransformerLens is not required, just plain Transformers. For those previously unaware, this opens up abliteration experimentation to more people with local VRAM limitations. Since performing abliteration on a quant involves precision and perplexity loss, it stands to reason that a small amount of magnitude sparsification could filter out some noise and possibly even reduce the damage inflicted on latent space via ablation of the refusal vector. There's a small but real acceleration of ablation of the refusal vector by reducing outer product operations from O(d²×n) to O(d×n), and then by pushing said computation layerwise to GPU. The code is hardcoded for...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/grimjim/556474107312531</guid></item><item><title>12 Excellent MCP Servers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/566496725881885</link><description>12 Excellent MCP Servers The family of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers keeps expanding to bridge agents, models, tools, web, data and apps.

It is a *protocol* — reproducible, auditable, teachable. Three demonstrations (acting/self-reference, math/nonverbal, martial/cosmic) were enough to prove the point. Genius was never about *who* did it, but *how* structure makes such leaps possible. &gt; To end the myth of genius &gt; is to begin its practice by everyone. --- Why It Matters: • Demystifies genius, reframing it as systematic structural method • Shows why only a few demonstrations are sufficient — reproducibility is the proof • Opens the door for education, AI, and research to cultivate genius procedurally --- What’s Inside: • Recap of the protocol and its demonstrations • Reflection on why “enough examples” suffices structurally • Implications: from talent myths to...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/517613830750903</guid></item><item><title>🐾 Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? 🐱💖</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ethank01/155417923515007</link><description>🐾 Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? 🐱💖 With iMini’s Nano Banana sticker template, you can turn your cat’s photo into adorable nine-grid stickers 🎨✨.
