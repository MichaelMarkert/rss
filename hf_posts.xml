FLOW is the platform that lets you use VEO 3 with so many cool features. This is an official tutorial and guide made by Google team. I edited it slightly. I hope this be helpful. FLOW : https://labs.google/flow/about Veo 3 is Google DeepMind’s most advanced video generation model to date. It allows users to create high-quality, cinematic video clips from simple text prompts, making it one of the most powerful AI tools for video creation. What sets Veo 3 apart is its ability to generate videos with native audio. This means that along with stunning visuals, Veo 3 can produce synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all from a single prompt. For filmmakers, this is a significant leap forward, as it eliminates the need for separate audio generation or complex syncing processes.

App-Use lets you scope agents to just the apps they need. Instead of full desktop access, say "only work with Safari and Notes" or "just control iPhone Mirroring" - visual isolation without new processes for perfectly focused automation. Running computer-use on the entire desktop often causes agent hallucinations and loss of focus when they see irrelevant windows and UI elements. App-Use solves this by creating composited views where agents only see what matters, dramatically improving task completion accuracy What you can build: Research agents working in Safari while writing agents draft in Notes, iPhone automation for messages and reminders, parallel testing across isolated app sessions, or teams of specialized agents working simultaneously without interference. Currently macOS-only (Quartz compositing engine).

System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. 🚀 How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. 📊 Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% → 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% → 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% → 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. ✨ Key benefits: 🔄 Cumulative learning over time 📖 Transparent, inspectable strategies 🔌 Works with any OpenAI-compatible API ⚡ Simple integration: just add "spl-" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm. After 500 queries, our system developed 129 strategies and refined 97 of them! This feels like a genuine step toward AI that learns...</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 09:26:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200</guid></item></channel></rss>
