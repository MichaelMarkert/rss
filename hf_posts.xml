Today, we announce Mistral 3, the next generation of Mistral models. Mistral 3 includes three state-of-the-art small, dense models (14B, 8B, and 3B) and Mistral Large 3 – our most capable model to date – a sparse mixture-of-experts trained with 41B active and 675B total parameters. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

But what happens when you need to scale beyond that, where the bandwidth drops? That is where Pipeline Parallelism (PP) takes over. Instead of slicing the operation, PP slices the model depth. It turns your GPU cluster into an assembly line: GPU 0 handles layers 1-12, GPU 1 handles 13-24, and so on. The hardware challenge here isn't the interconnect speed—it is the "Pipeline Bubble." In a naive setup, expensive H100s sit idle for most of the cycle waiting for data to flow through the chain. My latest guide breaks down the scheduling strategies used to minimize this idle silicon time. In this deep dive, we cover: The Hardware Mechanics: Vertical Slicing Unlike TP which requires "chatty" All-Reduce operations, PP relies on lightweight Point-to-Point (Send/Recv) communication. This makes it the only viable strategy for crossing node boundaries over Ethernet or InfiniBand.

Concepts like “agent swarms” were highlighted at the AI Engineer Code Summit in NYC (Nov 20–21) as the winning architecture. And this trend is not only about coding and software. It applies across all AI domains. So here is some recent research that helps keep multi-agent systems (MAS) better and up-to-date: 1. LatentMAS → Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems (2511.20639) AI agents share their hidden "thoughts" directly in latent space instead of talking through text. This makes collaboration and reasoning way faster and accurate (no extra training needed) 2. Puppeteer → Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration (2505.19591) Uses a “puppeteer” LLM that dynamically decides which agents (“puppets”) to call and in what order. By learning this orchestration...</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:26:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/298526462161147</guid></item><item><title>September(2025) LLM Safety &amp; Reliability Benchmarks Report By AI Parivartan Research Lab (AIPRL-LIR)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/rajkumarrawal/715420178191599</link><description>September(2025) LLM Safety &amp; Reliability Benchmarks Report By AI Parivartan Research Lab (AIPRL-LIR) Monthly LLM's Intelligence Reports for AI Decision Makers : Our "aiprl-llm-intelligence-report" repo to establishes (AIPRL-LIR) framework for Large Language Model overall evaluation and analysis through systematic monthly intelligence reports.
