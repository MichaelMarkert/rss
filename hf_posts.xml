Humans often solve visual problems by sketching ideas in our minds. What if Vision-Language Models (VLMs) could do something similar, not by generating full images, but by using internal “mental sketches”? That’s the idea behind Mirage, a new framework that empowers VLMs to reason using latent visual tokens. Instead of just thinking in words, Mirage mixes in abstract visual representations that help the model solve complex tasks. These aren't photorealistic images. They're compact, internal representations optimized purely to support reasoning. 🔧 Mirage is trained in two phases: 1) Grounding: It learns to produce latent tokens anchored in real images. 2) Refinement: The model drops the images and learns to generate visual tokens on its own. 📈 And yes, it works! On challenging benchmarks like Visual Spatial Planning, Jigsaw puzzles, and Spatial Attention Tasks, Mirage clearly outperforms GPT-4o and other strong baselines. Smart sketches &gt; empty words....</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 09:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/535116877809522</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal OCR with ReportLab?

The Pattern Learning Bridge equips AI with the ability to reflect structurally — not just on results, but on *why* certain reasoning paths succeed or fail. This protocol enables agents to: • Log reasoning attempts in a structured format • Analyze success/failure correlations across problem types • Extract reusable frame-jump patterns with confidence scoring • Proactively adapt future reasoning choices It’s not just about having memory — it’s about having *experience*. Key Features: • Detects recurring reasoning traps •...</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 09:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/563668515609459</guid></item><item><title>Is 100% on HumanEval still possible?
