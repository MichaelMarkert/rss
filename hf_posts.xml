Three is always better than one! 3x AMD Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 384GB RAM 24TB of RAID storage Ubuntu 24.04 ROCm 7.0.2 llama cpp, vLLM and Aibrix Small, cheap GPUs are about to become the Raspberry Pi of edge AI inference. Sprinkle some kubectl fairy dust on top, and suddenly it's a high-availability, self-healing, cloud-native, enterprise-grade AI cluster camping in a closet. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it’s aligned with the company that owns it.

With FlashPack, loading any model can be 3–6× faster than with the current state-of-the-art methods like accelerate or the standard load_state_dict() and to() flow — all wrapped in a lightweight, pure-Python package that works anywhere.

The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. 👥 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li 📅 Conference: ICCV, 19 – 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA 🇺🇸 📄 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) 📁 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM 🚀 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers 🚀 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md 📚 More...</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 17:18:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420</guid></item><item><title>How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models 📰</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/973945902491280</link><description>How Financial News Can Be Used to Train Good Financial Models 📰 Numbers tell you what happened, but news tells you why. I’ve written an article explaining how news can be used to train AI models for sentiment analysis and better forecasting. Hope you find it interesting!

A new paper, "Stuck in the Matrix: Probing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models" compares performance on a handful of spacial reasoning tasks and finds all SOTA LLMs breaking down and hallucinating their faces off when the grids get large. https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20198v1 The word search task is especially revealing: notice the bias towards detecting "horizontal" while struggling with "vertical" - LLMs only understand simple, linear relationships.. add a stride for 2D and it's basically over.

Here who is gaining the most: SelmaNajih001/InvestmentStrategyBasedOnSentiment The Space uses titles from this dataset: 📊 SelmaNajih001/Cnbc_MultiCompany Given a news title, it calculates a sentiment score : if the score crosses a certain threshold, the strategy decides to buy or sell. Each trade lasts one day, and the strategy then computes the daily return. For Tesla the best model seems to be the regression 👀 Just a quick note: the model uses the closing price as the buy price, meaning it already reflects the impact of the news.
