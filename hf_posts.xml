This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -&gt; CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -&gt; Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns. Helps in plug-and-play tool use without training new...</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:38:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918</guid></item><item><title>fav open-source multimodal reasoning model just got an update üî•</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/432717492221522</link><description>fav open-source multimodal reasoning model just got an update üî• moonshotai/Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 has &gt; smarter with less tokens, small size (only 3B active params!!!) &gt; better accuracy &gt; video reasoning &gt; higher resolution ü§Ø Read their blog https://huggingface.co/blog/moonshotai/kimi-vl-a3b-thinking-2506 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:38:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/432717492221522</guid></item><item><title>üí´ Next-Level On-Device AI Showdown</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/882369268235109</link><description>üí´ Next-Level On-Device AI Showdown ü™Ω See It to Believe It, How QWEN4b works at On-device environment without expensive GPU Cloud server?

It latches onto a single line of thought and fails to produce a robust, well-rounded plan. This is a common struggle I've called the "AI Reasoning Paradox." To tackle this, I developed Trinity-Synthesis, a multi-agent architecture designed to force reflection and synthesis before delivering a final answer. The philosophy is simple: constructive conflict between different perspectives leads to better solutions. Here‚Äôs the core idea: Instead of one agent, it uses four agents running on the same base model but with different "personalities" defined by their system prompts and temperature settings: üß† The Visionary: Thinks outside the box (high temp: 1.0). üìä The Analyst: Focuses on logic, data, and structure (low temp: 0.3). üõ†Ô∏è The Pragmatist: Evaluates feasibility, costs, and risks (mid temp: 0.5). These three "thinkers" work in parallel on the...</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:38:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/brainhome/128948549150065</guid></item><item><title>y'all have been asking my opinion on how OCR models compare to each other üëÄ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/300457326273979</link><description>y'all have been asking my opinion on how OCR models compare to each other üëÄ I will leave three apps to compare newest models by @ prithivMLmods instead ‚§µÔ∏è &gt; compare Nanonets-OCR-s, Qwen2-VL-OCR-2B-Instruct, RolmOCR, Aya-Vision prithivMLmods/Multimodal-OCR &gt; SmolDocling, Nanonets-OCR-s, MonkeyOCR, Typhoon-OCR-7B prithivMLmods/Multimodal-OCR2 &gt; docscopeOCR, MonkeyOCR, coreOCR prithivMLmods/core-OCR See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:38:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/300457326273979</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Classifier: Dynamic Text Classification with Strategic Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/825512802076392</link><description>Adaptive Classifier: Dynamic Text Classification with Strategic Learning New text classification system that learns continuously without catastrophic forgetting.
