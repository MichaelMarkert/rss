Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -&gt; InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -&gt; CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -&gt; ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:32:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893</guid></item><item><title>Energy is a massive constraint for AI but do you even know what energy your chatGPT convos are using?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/clem/295367997414146</link><description>Energy is a massive constraint for AI but do you even know what energy your chatGPT convos are using? We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!

MalayLM is also attractive for organizations wishing to preserve data privacy as it s efficiency allows it to run on a local machine. 🧠 MamayLM is trained on high-quality Ukrainian data and understands Ukrainian language, culture, and history. It is built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 9B model, but uses a number of new advances stemming from INSAIT’s experience in creating BgGPT, a Bulgarian LLM we released last year, now adopted nationwide and profiled several times by Google as a worldwide success case. 🤝 MamayLM is developed in a...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:32:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hannayukhymenko/367157502110648</guid></item><item><title>SkyReels-V2 🔥 UNLIMITED duration video generation model by Kunlun Tech-Skywork 天工</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/513759960651834</link><description>SkyReels-V2 🔥 UNLIMITED duration video generation model by Kunlun Tech-Skywork 天工 Paper: SkyReels-V2: Infinite-length Film Generative Model (2504.13074) Model: Skywork/skyreels-v2-6801b1b93df627d441d0d0d9 ✨ 1.3B &amp; 14B ✨ Generates infinite length videos using Diffusion Forcing with diffusion models + autoregressive methods See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:32:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/513759960651834</guid></item><item><title>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/406218973183679</link><description>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀 🌟 Introduction Hello, AI research community! 🎉 Introducing Papers Impact - the revolutionary AI tool that automatically grades and predicts the potential impact of research papers! 🧠💡 VIDraft/PapersImpact ✨ Key Feature: Instant Paper Grading The core functionality is brilliantly simple: Just enter an arXiv paper ID or URL, and our AI instantly analyzes and grades the paper's potential academic impact!
