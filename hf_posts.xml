Ark just got a major upgrade: We’ve now integrated Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) into Ark 🎉 VLAs = models that connect vision + language → robot actions (see image) What does this mean? 🗣️ Give robots natural language instructions → they act 👀 Combine perception + language for real-world control 🦾 Powered by pi0 pretrained models for fast prototyping ⚡ Supports easy data collection and fine-tuning within Ark within a couple of lines of code Next, we plan to go into the world of designing worlds 😉 Who knows, maybe those video models are actually zero-shot learners and reasoners? Check it out here 👉 https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_framework Check out the tutorial 👉 https://arkrobotics.notion.site/VLA-Pi0-with-Ark-279e053d9c6f800ab0a2d498835dd96b ⭐ Star the repo, try it with your robots, and let us together make robots great (again?)!
