Today, Gradio is used by &gt;1 million developers each month to build and share AI web apps. This includes some of the most popular open-source projects of all time, like Automatic1111, Fooocus, Oobabooga’s Text WebUI, Dall-E Mini, and LLaMA-Factory. How did we get here? How did Gradio keep growing in the very crowded field of open-source Python libraries? I get this question a lot from folks who are building their own open-source libraries. This post distills some of the lessons that I have learned over the past few years: 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level abstractions 2. Embed virality directly into your library 3. Focus on a (growing) niche 4. Your only roadmap should be rapid iteration 5. Maximize ways users can consume your library's outputs 1. Invest in good primitives, not high-level...</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 05:22:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/192598522318521</guid></item><item><title>Did we just drop personalized AI evaluation?!

This tool auto-generates custom benchmarks on your docs to test which models are the best. Most benchmarks test general capabilities, but what matters is how models handle your data and tasks. YourBench helps answer critical questions like: - Do you really need a hundreds-of-billions-parameter model sledgehammer to crack a nut? - Could a smaller, fine-tuned model work better? - How well do different models understand your domain? Some cool features: 📚 Generates custom benchmarks from your own documents (PDFs, Word, HTML) 🎯 Tests models on real tasks, not just general capabilities 🔄 Supports multiple models for different pipeline stages 🧠 Generate both single-hop and multi-hop questions 🔍 Evaluate top models and deploy leaderboards instantly 💰 Full cost analysis to optimize for your budget 🛠️ Fully configurable via a single YAML file 26 SOTA models tested for question generation.

I tested this model on my MacBook Air with M1 processor and 8GB of RAM, which is the lower bound of Apple Silicon, also the earliest and still the most popular. On average it took 16 seconds to generate a SQL query, and one minute in the worst case. If you own a newer MacBook with M2 or M3, the speed should be considerably faster. I hope the MLX team will improve inference speed by software tricks (definitely doable) in the future. Meanwhile, if you find the current inference speed acceptable, you are more than welcome to enjoy this model. 🤗 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 05:22:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/914618105461192</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of Specialized LLMs for Enterprise -https://mltblog.com/3QXXE4I</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/309576040156740</link><description>The Rise of Specialized LLMs for Enterprise -https://mltblog.com/3QXXE4I In this article, I discuss the main problems of standard LLMs (OpenAI and the likes), and how the new generation of LLMs addresses these issues. The focus is on Enterprise LLMs. LLMs with Billions of Parameters: Most of the LLMs still fall in that category. The first ones (ChatGPT) appeared around 2022, though Bert is an early precursor. Most recent books discussing LLMs still define them as transformer architecture with deep neural networks (DNNs), costly training, and reliance on GPUs. The training is optimized to predict the next tokens or missing tokens. However, this task is remotely relevant to what modern LLMs now deliver to the user, see here. Yet it requires time and intensive computer resources. Indeed, this type of architecture works best with billions or trillions of tokens. In the end, most of these tokens are noise, requiring smart distillation for performance improvement. The main issues are: ➡️...</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 05:22:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/309576040156740</guid></item></channel></rss>
