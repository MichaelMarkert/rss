With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -&gt; https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -&gt; https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3. WebThinker -&gt; https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/WebThinker Lets reasoning models...</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:21:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/947704683052150</guid></item><item><title>🧠 SOMA: The Core Architecture for AGI Level 1 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/674788441765421</link><description>🧠 SOMA: The Core Architecture for AGI Level 1 🚀 VIDraft/SOMA-AGI 🎯 The First Step Toward AGI SOMA (Self-Orchestrating Modular Architect) is a revolutionary architecture that fulfills the essential requirements for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Level 1. It perfectly implements the common AGI prerequisites emphasized by Yann LeCun (Meta), OpenAI, and Google DeepMind within a single LLM. 📋 AGI Level 1 Core Requirements = SOMA's Perfect Implementation ✅ 🎯 Planning Capability → Supervisor AI autonomously designs and executes comprehensive analysis roadmaps 🧩 Role Differentiation &amp; Modularity → A single LLM instantly differentiates into 5 expert AIs for collaboration 🔄 Self-reflection &amp; Feedback Loops → Evaluator AI continuously validates and directs improvements 🛠️ Tool-use &amp; Autonomy → Full automation from web search to report generation 🎮 Long-term Agency Structure → Completes complex 11-stage collaborative processes end-to-end 🔷 SOMA's Three Core Structures 🧭 Self-...</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:21:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/674788441765421</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview is Now Open Source!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/404767027882987</link><description>🎉 Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview is Now Open Source! The world's first Intermediate Thinking Model is now available to everyone! Dhanishtha 2.0 Preview brings revolutionary intermediate thinking capabilities to the open-source community. Unlike traditional reasoning models that think once, Dhanishtha can think, answer, rethink, answer again, and continue rethinking as needed using multiple blocks between responses. 🚀 Key Features - Intermediate thinking: Think → Answer → Rethink → Answer → Rethink if needed... - Token efficient: Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 on similar queries - Transparent thinking: See the model's reasoning process in real-time - Open source: Freely available for research and development HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-2.0-preview https://helpingai.co/chat See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:21:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/404767027882987</guid></item><item><title>so many multimodal releases these days 🤠</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/587280854326828</link><description>so many multimodal releases these days 🤠 &gt; ERNIE-4.5-VL: new vision language MoE models by Baidu https://huggingface.co/models?search=ernie-4.5-vl &gt; new visual document retrievers by NVIDIA (sota on ViDoRe!) nvidia/llama-nemoretriever-colembed-3b-v1 nvidia/llama-nemoretriever-colembed-1b-v1 &gt; Ovis-3b: new image-text in image-text out models by Alibaba ⤵️ https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIDC-AI/Ovis-U1- See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:21:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/587280854326828</guid></item><item><title>I find it really annoying that you can use a Zero GPU model that will throw an error but it’ll still take the processing time from your quota.
