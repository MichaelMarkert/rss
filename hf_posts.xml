His model achieved perfect real-world detection accuracy without a single real image in the training loop. In this blog, Dr. Sanz walks us through his method, which includes the design and training of an advanced pipeline to achieve 100% detection accuracy. His full technical breakdown covers: 📍 Synthetic-only training 📍 Data augmentation with an ensemble learning approach for better generalization 📍 Custom occlusion generation 📍 A Faster R-CNN model fine-tuned with Falcon generated data 📍 And much more! The results speak for themselves! 📖 Read the blog here: https://www.duality.ai/blog/leveraging-synthetic-data-for-real-world-object-detection Congratulations Sergio!

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/ε²) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, ε = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/ε) examples (where d = input...</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:23:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125</guid></item><item><title>Recently, I've been focusing my learning on the following topics:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283</link><description>Recently, I've been focusing my learning on the following topics: - Pytorch internals, specifically the inductor system (roughly ~1 month of experience) - Triton internals (~8 moe) - CUDA (~3 moe) - Understanding fusion patterns in compilers and how to improve them (~1 moe) - Parallelism strategies for large scale inference optimization (~6-7 moe) I thought it would be nice to document it somewhere for no particular reason. Maybe someone will find it useful? It's also because I want to get into the habit of writing, but had no motivation to do so. Maybe writing short informal posts will help build the habit. Since I don't have a personal site, and don't plan to create one in the near future, I think HF posts are best suited for short and informal documentation to share my little discoveries and learnings. If you're interested, strap in! First post in this series will be on basic study of Pytorch's float32 matmuls and their Triton implementation (nothing much, just the tutorial...</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:23:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283</guid></item><item><title>⚡ FusionX Enhanced Wan 2.1 I2V (14B) 🎬</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/480409853177984</link><description>⚡ FusionX Enhanced Wan 2.1 I2V (14B) 🎬 🚀 Revolutionary Image-to-Video Generation Model Generate cinematic-quality videos in just 8 steps!
