Concepts like “agent swarms” were highlighted at the AI Engineer Code Summit in NYC (Nov 20–21) as the winning architecture. And this trend is not only about coding and software. It applies across all AI domains. So here is some recent research that helps keep multi-agent systems (MAS) better and up-to-date: 1. LatentMAS → Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems (2511.20639) AI agents share their hidden "thoughts" directly in latent space instead of talking through text. This makes collaboration and reasoning way faster and accurate (no extra training needed) 2. Puppeteer → Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration (2505.19591) Uses a “puppeteer” LLM that dynamically decides which agents (“puppets”) to call and in what order. By learning this orchestration...</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 09:33:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/298526462161147</guid></item><item><title>hello, who can help me setup a local LLM and RAG for my job i can pay</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/aiconta/768879073281998</link><description>hello, who can help me setup a local LLM and RAG for my job i can pay See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 09:33:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/aiconta/768879073281998</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Anim Lab AI⚡</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ovi054/498416611324104</link><description>Introducing Anim Lab AI⚡ My submission for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon Turn any math concept or logic into a clear video explanation instantly using AI. 👉 Try it now: MCP-1st-Birthday/anim-lab-ai Demo outputs are attached 👇 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 09:33:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ovi054/498416611324104</guid></item><item><title>4月？ごろに参加したCerebrasのハッカソンから何故かHuggingfaceのproプランが続いてるんですよね...</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Holy-fox/916850799845292</link><description>4月？ごろに参加したCerebrasのハッカソンから何故かHuggingfaceのproプランが続いてるんですよね... 多分ハッカソン期間だけのはずなんだけど、外れないのよね。 まあ、クレカとかは登録してないから大丈夫だとは思うけど See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 09:33:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Holy-fox/916850799845292</guid></item><item><title>nanochat is now in transformers!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/367599205240435</link><description>nanochat is now in transformers!

Much higher costs but with better reliability and predictability (let me know if you'd like to sponsor this!). ・ Dataset sizes are unfortunately missing for this month due to shenanigans with the migration, but should be back in December's update.

I'm optimistic on this front. Our actions are driven by unspeakable instincts, which left no traces in training set (pretraining or synthetic). These process rewards (motion sensing, vision etc.) help you master new skills quickly, like biking. Outcome reward only (falling off the bike) is indeed too sparse. But lots of tasks can benefit from outcome rewards alone. Many latest RL works to upgrade SQL skills use success-failure reward only, with executable as optional reward. Additionally, scale is the secret sauce for models to surpass humans. A human agent can learn a task quickly, but is capacity limited. But a model agent can process tasks in the scale of many human lifetimes. This made up for the inadequacy of process rewards. Many such tasks happen to be economically viable, i.e. salary-making jobs.
