At roughly ~15M parameters, it runs fast on modest hardware, supports multiple expressive voices, and exposes simple controls for pacing and tone. This makes it ideal for edge devices, demos, and anyone who wants full control over TTS without latency, lock-in, or infrastructure overhead.

Type 2 in Project Enneagram just came out: vanta-research/PE-Type-2-Alma-4B PE-Type-2-Alma-4B is the second release in Project Enneagram, where I'm finetuning each of the 9 Enneagram types onto Gemma 3 4B Type 2-Alma is designed to exhibit the "helper" profile: - Empathetic Support: Emotional attunement - managing bad days, anxiety, grief, rejection, or feeling unseen - Interpersonal Connections: Relationship building - making friends, listening, conflict, reciprocity, apologies - Generous Guidance: Going above and beyond - cover letters, meal prep, gardening, wedding speeches, etc - Identity: Alma's name, tone, and conversational style Type 3 soon!

No long CoT. Reasoning happens inside the hidden states, not in the output. What’s different 🧠 Implicit reasoning: deep causal reasoning without exposing chains 🕸️ ASPP (Adjacency-Structured Parallel Propagation): parent-only causal graph, O(n) message passing 🌊 π-flow: internal probability-space refinement instead of token-level deliberation ⚖️ Hybrid gating: learns when to use structure vs attention Why it matters Lower latency &amp; token cost Cleaner, production-ready outputs CoT-level reasoning depth without verbosity tax Built on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, trained for math, logic, and commonsense.
