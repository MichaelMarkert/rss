The wild part? While AI gets ridiculously more accessible, the power gap is actually widening: 1️⃣ The democratization of AI capabilities is accelerating rapidly: - The gap between open and closed models is basically closed: difference in benchmarks like MMLU and HumanEval shrunk to just 1.7% in 2024 - The cost to run GPT-3.5-level performance dropped 280x in 2 years - Model size is shrinking while maintaining performance - Phi-3-mini hitting 60%+ MMLU at fraction of parameters of early models like PaLM 2️⃣ But we're seeing concerning divides deepening: - Geographic: US private investment ($109B) dwarfs everyone else - 12x China's $9.3B - Research concentration: US and China dominate highly-cited papers (50 and 34 respectively in 2023), while next closest is only 7 - Gender: Major gaps in AI skill penetration rates - US shows 2.39 vs 1.71 male/female ratio The tech is getting more accessible but the benefits aren't...</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:19:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/650208950263848</guid></item><item><title>Qwen 3 can launch very soon. 👀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/235850739835485</link><description>Qwen 3 can launch very soon. 👀 https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12828 See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:19:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/235850739835485</guid></item><item><title>AI agents are transforming how we interact with technology, but how sustainable are they? 🌍</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/BrigitteTousi/559995441481207</link><description>AI agents are transforming how we interact with technology, but how sustainable are they? 🌍 Design choices — like model size and structure — can massively impact energy use and cost. ⚡💰 The key takeaway: smaller, task-specific models can be far more efficient than large, general-purpose ones. 🔑 Open-source models offer greater transparency, allowing us to track energy consumption and make more informed decisions on deployment. 🌱 Open-source = more efficient, eco-friendly, and accountable AI.

We dropped two brand-new datasets capturing Human Preferences for text-to-video and text-to-image generations powered by our own crowdsourcing tool! Whether you're working on model evaluation, alignment, or fine-tuning, this is for you. 1. Text-to-Video Dataset (Pika 2.2 model): Rapidata/text-2-video-human-preferences-pika2.2 2. Text-to-Image Dataset (Reve-AI Halfmoon): Rapidata/Reve-AI-Halfmoon_t2i_human_preference Let’s train AI on AI-generated content with humans in the loop. Let’s make generative models that actually get us.

We've investigated some quants and have seen that a considerable portion of quantizations of the same model share the same bytes and can be deduplicated to save considerable upload time for quantizers on the Hub. This space where we crack open a repo from @ bartowski shows we can get significant dedupe xet-team/quantization-dedup You can get a sense of why by reading this write-up: https://github.com/bartowski1182/llm-knowledge/blob/main/quantization/quantization.md But what about finetuned models? Since going into production the xet-team has migrated hundreds of repositories on the Hub to our storage layer, including classic "pre-Hub" open-source models like FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-large (XLM-R) from FacebookAI XLM-R, introduced in 2019, set new benchmarks for multilingual NLP by learning shared representations across 100 languages.
