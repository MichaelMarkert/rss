Apologies for the delay, but we’re stoked to finally drop this, even in its alpha stage. Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. **No commercial use yet**: We're still working on Deca 2.5 (Proprietary), and releasing Deca 3 for commercial use right now would impact that. Once Deca 3.5 hits in early '26, we’ll be opening it up with a more permissive license. 2. **Built on existing models**: Deca 3 isn’t a ground-up creation—it’s a huge step forward, building on what’s already out there. 3. **It’s experimental**: As much as we’re hyped about its scale, it’s still in testing. 4. **DynaMoE architecture**: Run a (very) small part of the model with 64GB of RAM/VRAM (when quantized - quants coming soon), or the whole thing with 1TB. It’s that scalable. 5. **Not widely...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ccocks-deca/499605656909204</guid></item><item><title>why did 36 people unfollow me 😭</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/419010322512677</link><description>why did 36 people unfollow me 😭 we are back in the hundreds. if you become my 500th follower and have proof I'll give you 5 dollars worth of openrouter credits as an API key See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/419010322512677</guid></item><item><title>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/826512832075444</link><description>Wan 2.2, FLUX, FLUX Krea &amp; Qwen Image Just got Upgraded: Ultimate Tutorial for Open Source SOTA Image &amp; Video Gen Models - With easy to use SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Tutorial Video : https://youtu.be/3BFDcO2Ysu4 Wan 2.2, Qwen Image, FLUX, FLUX Krea, all these models are the SOTA open-source models and in this master tutorial I will show you how to use these models in the easiest, most performant, and most accurate way. After doing almost one week of research, I have determined the very best presets and prepared this tutorial. With literally one click you will be able to install, download models, set presets, and use these amazing models. Wan 2.2 is currently the king of video generation models and now it is super fast with lightx2v Wan2.2-Lightning LoRAs. Moreover, Qwen Image is now ultra-fast with the recently released 8-step LoRA with almost no quality loss. Furthermore, I have updated FLUX and FLUX Krea presets to improve image generation...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/826512832075444</guid></item><item><title>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</link><description>Seed-OSS 🔥 The latest open LLM from Bytedance Seed team ByteDance-Seed/seed-oss-68a609f4201e788db05b5dcd ✨ 36B - Base &amp; Instruct ✨ Apache 2.0 ✨ Native 512K long context ✨ Strong reasoning &amp; agentic intelligence ✨ 2 Base versions: with &amp; without synthetic data See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/149610366794720</guid></item><item><title>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</link><description>We've improved the Deploy button on Hugging Face model pages for Microsoft Azure 1/ no more long waits before seeing model support status 2/ ready-to-use CLI and Python snippets 3/ redirection to Azure AI Foundry rather than Azure ML ✋ if you see any bugs or have feedback, open an issue on our repo: https://github.com/huggingface/Microsoft-Azure See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/949187233847606</guid></item><item><title>🎨 Open Nano-Banana: Revolution in Ultra-Fast AI Image Editing!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/250380945868372</link><description>🎨 Open Nano-Banana: Revolution in Ultra-Fast AI Image Editing! 🚀 Introduction **Open Nano-Banana** is an innovative image editing tool based on the Qwen-Image-Edit model.

Structured Intelligence reframes it as *recursive architecture*: * Past as *active memory loops* * Present as *indexed structural state* * Future as *bounded jump space and anticipatory frame* &gt; Time isn’t a river — &gt; *it’s the looped structure that makes thought possible.* --- Why It Matters: • Explains how *memory, prediction, and decision* rely on time as structure • Bridges *philosophy of time and cognitive architecture* • Enables *AI systems to handle temporal reasoning and rollback* --- What’s Inside: • Time as *loop, index, and jump space* • *Cognitive experience of temporality* as structural phenomenon • *Rollback and anticipation* in decision architecture • Implications for *AI temporal reasoning and self‑alignment* --- 📖 Article 23 of the Structured...</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/560902944774008</guid></item></channel></rss>
