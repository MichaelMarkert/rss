Three is always better than one! 3x AMD Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 384GB RAM 24TB of RAID storage Ubuntu 24.04 ROCm 7.0.2 llama cpp, vLLM and Aibrix Small, cheap GPUs are about to become the Raspberry Pi of edge AI inference. Sprinkle some kubectl fairy dust on top, and suddenly it's a high-availability, self-healing, cloud-native, enterprise-grade AI cluster camping in a closet. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it’s aligned with the company that owns it.

The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. 👥 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li 📅 Conference: ICCV, 19 – 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA 🇺🇸 📄 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) 📁 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM 🚀 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers 🚀 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md 📚 More...</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 13:26:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420</guid></item><item><title>FlashPack: Lightning-Fast Model Loading for PyTorch</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/gokaygokay/758462412009896</link><description>FlashPack: Lightning-Fast Model Loading for PyTorch https://github.com/fal-ai/flashpack FlashPack — a new, high-throughput file format and loading mechanism for PyTorch that makes model checkpoint I/O blazingly fast, even on systems without access to GPU Direct Storage (GDS). With FlashPack, loading any model can be 3–6× faster than with the current state-of-the-art methods like accelerate or the standard load_state_dict() and to() flow — all wrapped in a lightweight, pure-Python package that works anywhere.

I’ve written an article explaining how news can be used to train AI models for sentiment analysis and better forecasting. Hope you find it interesting!

Here who is gaining the most: SelmaNajih001/InvestmentStrategyBasedOnSentiment The Space uses titles from this dataset: 📊 SelmaNajih001/Cnbc_MultiCompany Given a news title, it calculates a sentiment score : if the score crosses a certain threshold, the strategy decides to buy or sell. Each trade lasts one day, and the strategy then computes the daily return. For Tesla the best model seems to be the regression 👀 Just a quick note: the model uses the closing price as the buy price, meaning it already reflects the impact of the news.

But this provocative article provoked the community quite a bit. The case in point is Claude Code, which happens to be my biggest productivity revolution since ChatGPT. RAG predated TUI and agents. So to be fair it's quite an achievement to survive the AI evolution. But I feel it is overshadowed by context engineering in the agent era.
