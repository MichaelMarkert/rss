With FlashPack, loading any model can be 3–6× faster than with the current state-of-the-art methods like accelerate or the standard load_state_dict() and to() flow — all wrapped in a lightweight, pure-Python package that works anywhere.

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts (2307.03172) I spotted the same problem in coding tasks, and documented in my book ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/9999331130 ). Why did this problem become hot again? This is because many of us thought the problem has been solved by long context models, which is not true. Here we were misled by benchmarks. Most long-context benchmarks build around the QA scenario, i.e. "finding needle in haystack". But in agentic scenarios, the model needs to find EVERYTHING in the haystack, and just can't afford enough attention for this challenge.

But this provocative article provoked the community quite a bit. The case in point is Claude Code, which happens to be my biggest productivity revolution since ChatGPT. RAG predated TUI and agents. So to be fair it's quite an achievement to survive the AI evolution. But I feel it is overshadowed by context engineering in the agent era.

Still very early and does have an issue with hallucinating but results seem pretty good so far, given that it is very early into the training run. Will probably kick off a new run later with some settings tweaked.

Dataset Distillation with Label Space Lightening 🔝 📝 Description: The HeLlO framework is a new corpus distillation method that removes the need for large soft labels. It uses a lightweight, online image-to-label projector based on CLIP. This projector has been adapted using LoRA-style, parameter-efficient tuning. It has also been initialized with text embeddings. 👥 Authors: @ roseannelexie , @ Huage001 , Zigeng Chen, Jingwen Ye, and Xinchao Wang 📅 Conference: ICCV, 19 – 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA 🇺🇸 📄 Paper: Heavy Labels Out!

A new paper, "Stuck in the Matrix: Probing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models" compares performance on a handful of spacial reasoning tasks and finds all SOTA LLMs breaking down and hallucinating their faces off when the grids get large. https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20198v1 The word search task is especially revealing: notice the bias towards detecting "horizontal" while struggling with "vertical" - LLMs only understand simple, linear relationships.. add a stride for 2D and it's basically over.

A more robust version should loop over the deployed app to fix build/runtime issues. - There is still a bit of human curation done to avoid making demos for things that can’t really be demonstrated on ZeroGPU (eg. tasks taking several minutes) - Some papers can actually be showcased in a variety of ways, which isn’t really supported (see Demo 2) See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 09:26:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jbilcke-hf/233313729271846</guid></item><item><title>Here is the official Florence-2 Transformers-converted demo for the following vision models:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/131495845206291</link><description>Here is the official Florence-2 Transformers-converted demo for the following vision models: florence-community/Florence-2-large , florence-community/Florence-2-large-ft , florence-community/Florence-2-base , and florence-community/Florence-2-base-ft .
