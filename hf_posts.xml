This week Hugging Face learn has a whole pathway on finetuning for agentic applications. You can follow these two courses to get knowledge on levelling up your agent game beyond prompts: 1️⃣ New Supervised Fine-tuning unit in the NLP Course https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter11/1 2️⃣New Finetuning for agents bonus module in the Agents Course https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/bonus-unit1/introduction Fine-tuning will squeeze everything out of your model for how you’re using it, more than any prompt.

I did the simplest random search strategy, but results can potentially be improved with better-guided search methods. Supports Gemini 2 Flash &amp; Qwen2.5 as verifiers for "LLMGrading" 🤗 The steps are simple: For each round: 1&gt; Starting by sampling 2 starting noises with different seeds. 2&gt; Score the generations w.r.t a metric. 3&gt; Obtain the best generation from the current round. If you have more compute budget, go to the next search round. Scale the noise pool ( 2 ** search_round ) and repeat 1 - 3. This constitutes the random search method as done in the paper by Google DeepMind. Code, more results, and a bunch of other stuff are in the repository.

It was developed by Microsoft Research in collaboration with Ninja Theory (Hellblade developer). It’s built on something called the World and Human Action Model (WHAM-1.6B model). They trained on 7 years of Bleeding Edge gameplay and it can generate 2 minute long 3D game sequences with consistent physics and character behaviors all from just a second of input. They’ve gone and open-sourced it too. Open weights, the WHAM Demonstrator, and sample data on Azure AI Foundry for anyone to play with.
