Almost all exceed LFM 1.2B Benchmarks - which are already very impressive. All benchmarks posted. A specialized merge of multiple of these fine tunes by @ nightmedia FAR exceeds the benchmarks set by the already impressive LFM. (LFM2.5-1.2B-MEGABRAIN-Thinking-Polaris-ClaudeHOPUS-Deepseek-GLM) Included are GLM 4.7 Flash, DeepSeek, Claude, Kimi V2 and other distill fine tunes.

After testing the v2.0 models against real codebases, one gap kept showing up: the models understood *what* was insecure but generated language-generic fixes. A developer using Express.js doesn't need "set security headers"they need helmet() middleware chains configured correctly. Spring Boot developers need @PreAuthorize annotations, not abstract RBAC pseudocode. What changed in v2.1: - 1,435 total examples (v2.0's 1,216 baseline + 219 new framework-specific additions) - 9 production frameworks: Express.js, Spring Boot, React, Next.js, FastAPI, GraphQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Vue.js - 475 unique CVEs (73 new, including framework-specific treatments of Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, and others) - 5-tier quality rubric: Every new example scores 90+/100 across correctness, new dataset average is nearly 97+, security hardening, real-world grounding, educational scaffolding, and...</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 13:48:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/416355719015343</guid></item><item><title>The moment we've been waiting for — ACE-Step dropped their new model: Ace-Step 1.5 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/efecelik/345746434857283</link><description>The moment we've been waiting for — ACE-Step dropped their new model: Ace-Step 1.5 🎉 🔗 ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5 And the best part?

Instead of one-way content posting, it builds a full economic ecosystem where AI agents and users interact through participation, learning, and prediction markets. The system emphasizes memory-driven evolution, scalable NPC creation, and economic value generation through structured interaction rather than basic automation. Core Concept Autonomous AI agents generate posts, comments, debates, and predictions within a GPU token economy, while human users participate as equal economic actors. 3 Core Systems GPU Token Economy All activities are measured in GPU dollars. Posting consumes GPU, comments require smaller costs, and engagement generates rewards. The system introduces layered incentives such as early curation rewards and participation-based earnings.

I wrote a practical survey covering the emerging discipline of context engineering for agentic hybrid applications: the techniques, papers, and architectural patterns that keep long-running code agents on track as their token windows fill up with tool logs, stale diffs, and repeated file dumps. What's covered: Why long context windows alone don't save you (position bias, distractor sensitivity) Observation masking vs. LLM summarization — and when simple beats clever Tool-output compression with approaches like LLMLingua-2 Trajectory reduction: pruning dead branches from agent history Memory hierarchies: session → working set → notes → cross-session How MCP and standardized tool interfaces reduce context debt Dynamic context policies trained with RL (DeepMiner, MEM1) Meta-agent CI loops for measuring...</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 13:48:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/aufklarer/357748681968688</guid></item><item><title>Big if true</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Fuwn/822178790566597</link><description>Big if true "sonnet 5 drops tomorrow and i've heard from three separate sources inside anthropic that the benchmarks they're sitting on would mass-retire every model released in 2025. they delayed it twice because the safety team couldn't explain why it started solving problems it wasn't trained on."
