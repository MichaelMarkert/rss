CodePlex served as Microsoft’s primary open-source hosting platform from 2006 to 2017. This dataset captures the distinct .NET and Windows-centric development ecosystem that flourished before the industry standardizing on GitHub. Key Stats: - 5,043,730 files from 38,087 repositories - 3.6 GB compressed Parquet - 91 programming languages (Heavily featuring C#, ASP.NET, and C++) - Cleaned of binaries, build artifacts, and vendor directories (node_modules, packages) - Includes platform-specific license metadata (Ms-PL, Ms-RL) See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:03:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/nyuuzyou/211988639050417</guid></item><item><title>LTX 2 &amp; Z Image Base Full Tutorial + Audio to Video Lip Sync + ComfyUI + SwarmUI + Windows + Cloud</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/813967180726808</link><description>LTX 2 &amp; Z Image Base Full Tutorial + Audio to Video Lip Sync + ComfyUI + SwarmUI + Windows + Cloud Full tutorial link &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc Info LTX 2 is the newest state of the art (SOTA) Open Source video generation model and tutorial will show you how to use it with very best and most performant way in ComfyUI and also in SwarmUI.

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

It focuses on Serbian understanding and generation while maintaining robust English reasoning. Built on the LLaMA-3 architecture with a proprietary hybrid reasoning mechanism, it delivers deep logic while keeping outputs concise and natural. 🚀 Core Innovations 💡 Implicit Deep Reasoning: Combines standard attention mechanisms with graph-structured reasoning components for rigorous logic and causal inference. 🕸️ ASPP &amp; -flow Hybrid Design: High-efficiency structured propagation + internal probability space optimization for high-quality reasoning without long-winded intermediate steps. ⚡ Bilingual Adaptation: Primarily focused on Serbian while preserving English logic, making it perfect for multilingual chats and cross-lingual tasks. 🌍 Lightweight...</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:03:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/OzTianlu/678257236628568</guid></item><item><title>Not for everybody, but the absolute mad craze about clawdbot/moltbook the last couple of days reminded me of a short story I wrote in 2018 (ancient times!).</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/neph1/280223950636420</link><description>Not for everybody, but the absolute mad craze about clawdbot/moltbook the last couple of days reminded me of a short story I wrote in 2018 (ancient times!). Synopsis: "A man insults a sentient traffic light on the way to a meeting. Little does he know it is connected to a social media network for AI, and that his action will lead to a very bad day."

Calypso Crunchies is an old account I used to use for diffusers conversions for someone. IF YOU WOULD LIKE ACCESS to ANYTHING -- I lost access due to me forgetting to jank Calypso into the E&amp;D old repo, but i can get Angel or someone to add me or my other account back.. I didn't want HF to lose 3 years of my insane progress in doing things, but i need to retire from Generative image AI fast, my mental health has been diving for so long. I'll continue in the developing/vibe coding./educational sphere, but I just can't continue in the other end of it.
