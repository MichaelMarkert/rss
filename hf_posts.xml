Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

And recently, we finally succeeded: We introduce "LAD: LoRA-Adapted Denoiser", a method to convert a LLaMA model into a text diffusion model using LoRA finetuning and structured input corruption. üéØ Try the demo and read the write-up here! https://ruurdkuiper.github.io/tini-lad/ Unlike autoregressive (word-for-word) models like ChatGPT, diffusion models iteratively refine a noised sequence. However, most current diffusion approaches rely on all-parameter retraining and repeatedly remasking tokens, which is costly and slow during both training and inference! üß† With LAD: - We can finetune an autoregressive model for diffusive generation in just 10 hours on a single GPU. - Test-time compute is fully adjustable: fewer steps means faster outputs while more steps improve output quality. - Due to our unique noising schedule, remasking is not always needed...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:26:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ruurd/491522052497480</guid></item><item><title>Having an insanely good medical LLM is pointless if it won‚Äôt answer your questions!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</link><description>Having an insanely good medical LLM is pointless if it won‚Äôt answer your questions!

It combines the sharp detection of YOLOv8, the semantic awareness of CLIP, the environmental grounding of Places365, and the expressive fluency of Llama 3.2. Together, they deliver more than bounding boxes, they produce rich narratives about layout, lighting, activities, and contextual cues. üèûÔ∏è For example: - CLIP‚Äôs zero-shot capability recognizes cultural landmarks without any task-specific training - Places365 helps anchor the scene into one of 365 categories, refining lighting interpretation and spatial understanding. It also assists in distinguishing indoor vs. outdoor scenes and enables lighting condition classification such as ‚Äúsunset‚Äù, ‚Äúsunrise‚Äù, or ‚Äúindoor commercial‚Äù - Llama 3.2 turns structured analysis into human-readable, context-rich...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:26:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/336678978162593</guid></item><item><title>Hi everyone,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jbilcke-hf/300373913700278</link><description>Hi everyone, I've seen some unsuccessful attempts at running Wan2GP inside a Hugging Face Space, which is a shame as it is a great Gradio app! So here is a fork that you can use, with some instructions on how to do this: jbilcke-hf/Wan2GP_you_must_clone_this_space_to_use_it#1 Note : some things like persistent models/storage/custom LoRAs might not be fully working out of the box. If you need those, you might have to dig into the Wan2GP codebase, see how to tweak the storage folder. Happy hacking!
