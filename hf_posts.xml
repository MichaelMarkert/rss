It costs me nothing, and I think it might be good to share it so that others can build on it. In README.md, you will find everything you need to get started and put your own microservice into production, which you can call from the app’s HTTP request features. You will simply be asked to have a free Cloudflare account and an API key obtained from Google's AI Studio. Feel free to take a look and get back to me if you encounter any problems during deployment. Here is the GitHub repo where you can find all the source code and run it on your own:...</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 05:20:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/louisbrulenaudet/591445663705551</guid></item><item><title>FastVLMs by Apple are the talk of the week for edge device VLMs and also for consumer-grade VLMs on the Hub.

Just type in your lifestyle or preferences (e.g. “I live in an apartment and want a quiet dog”), and PawMatchAI uses SBERT semantic embeddings to understand your needs and suggest compatible breeds. What can PawMatchAI do today? 📸 Upload a photo to identify your dog from 124 breeds with detailed info. ⚖️ Compare two breeds side-by-side, from grooming needs to health insights. 📊 Visualize breed traits with radar and comparison charts. 🎨 Try Style Transfer to turn your dog’s photo into anime, watercolor, cyberpunk, and more. What’s next? 🎯 More fine-tuned recommendations. 📱 Mobile-friendly deployment. 🐾 Expansion to additional species. My goal: To make breed discovery not only accurate but also interactive and fun — combining computer vision, semantic understanding, and creativity to help people find their perfect companion. 👉 Try it here: DawnC/PawMatchAI If you enjoy...</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 05:20:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/381537695345047</guid></item><item><title>We released a new competition!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/955693162356423</link><description>We released a new competition! https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/grocery-items-multi-class-object-detection/overview Join to: 💡 Learn from others 🤔 Develop your Sim2Real skills using simulation 📸 Generate custom data on the cloud to improve your model ✨ and more!

Training on this data dramatically improves the ability to execute code and analyze data. We ( @ baptistecolle @ hannayukhymenko @ lvwerra ) have created a novel synthetic data generation pipeline with efficient scaffolding, which gives a big performance boost after training your coding agent🔥With the help of real Kaggle notebooks and datasets we generate synthetic notebooks which aim to analyze datasets and answer factual questions about them more efficiently. We simulate a real code execution environment by prompting LLMs or with the help of E2B sandboxes. We have built a dataset of 50k+ high-quality LLM-generated notebooks which can help your agent become better at performing data analysis and question answering.
