Just released **OpenEvolve** - an open-source implementation of Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve system. It's an evolutionary coding agent that uses LLMs to discover and optimize algorithms. I successfully replicated DeepMind's results on circle packing (99.97% match!) and evolved a random search into a simulated annealing algorithm. ✨ Key features: - Evolves entire codebases (not just single functions) - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API - LLM ensemble approach for better results - Multi-objective optimization 👉 Check it out: GitHub: https://github.com/codelion/openevolve Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/openevolve Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about it!

This third-generation model, succeeding Veo 2, introduces groundbreaking features, most notably its ability to generate high-quality videos with integrated audio, including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise. Alongside Veo 3, Google introduced Flow, a new AI-driven video editing suite designed to empower filmmakers and content creators.

You fit the bill. We'd love to onboard you, get some feedback, and create some excitement 🎉 The steps are pretty straightforward - join the waitlist at hf.co/join/xet and we'll take care of the rest. The system is fully backward compatible, so you shouldn't notice a thing. BUT to get the best experience when uploading/downloading, make sure you have hf_xet installed alongside the latest huggingface_hub What do you think?

This was done long ago and got into CVPR25 -- super excited to finally share it now, along with the data and code ♥️ We explore several architectural choices that affect this design. We provide an open &amp; reproducible training recipe that works at scale. Works like Playground v3 have already explored a deep fusion between an LLM and a DiT, sharing their representations through layerwise attention. They exhibit excellent performance on T2I. Despite its compelling results and other performance virtues, it remains unexplored, which is what we want to improve in our work. Specifically, we take a pre-trained LLM (Gemma-2B) and trainable DiT, and set out to explore what makes a "good deep fusion" between the two for T2I. We explore several key questions in the work, such as: Q1: How should we do attention? We considered several alternatives.

This is a big step in making data more accessible and actionable for everyone. Here's some datasets you can try it out on: • mlabonne/FineTome-100k • Salesforce/APIGen-MT-5k • open-thoughts/OpenThoughts2-1M • allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture Any other good ones?
