Check out the chart below 👇 of CAS hitting up to 150 Gb/s throughput this past week. All of this growth is helping us build richer insights. We expanded our repo graph, which maps how Xet-backed repositories on the Hub share bytes with each other. Check out the current network in the image below (nodes are repositories, edges are where repos share bytes) and visit the space to see how different versions of Qwen, Llama, and Phi models are grouped together xet-team/repo-graph Join the waitlist to get access! https://huggingface.co/join/xet See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 17:20:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/177281245715492</guid></item><item><title>Want to know which AI models are least likely to hallucinate — and how to keep yours from spiking hallucinations by 20%?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/447589021070314</link><description>Want to know which AI models are least likely to hallucinate — and how to keep yours from spiking hallucinations by 20%? A new benchmark called Phare, by Giskard, tested leading models across multiple languages, revealing three key findings: 1️⃣ Popular models aren't necessarily factual. Some models ranking highest in user satisfaction benchmarks like LMArena are actually more prone to hallucination. 2️⃣ The way you ask matters - a lot. When users present claims confidently ("My teacher said..."), models are 15% less likely to correct misinformation vs. neutral framing ("I heard..."). 3️⃣ Telling models to "be concise" can increase hallucination by up to 20%. What's also cool is that the full dataset is public - use them to test your own models or dive deeper into the results!

Excited to share a new feature from the Gradio team along with a tutorial. If you don't already know, Gradio is an open-source Python library used to build interfaces for machine learning models. Beyond just creating UIs, Gradio also exposes API capabilities and now, Gradio apps can be launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for LLMs. If you already know how to use Gradio, there are only two additional things you need to do: * Add standard docstrings to your function (these will be used to generate the descriptions for your tools for the LLM) * Set mcp_server=True in launch() Here's a complete example (make sure you already have the latest version of Gradio installed): import gradio as gr def letter_counter ( word, letter ): """Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word. Args: word: The word or phrase to analyze letter: The letter to count occurrences of Returns: The number of times the letter appears in the word """ return...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 17:20:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/767083410530735</guid></item><item><title>𝗜 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗥𝗣𝗢! 👑 🗓️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/692858936883406</link><description>𝗜 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗥𝗣𝗢! 👑 🗓️ ✍️ Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo I experimented with GRPO lately. I am fascinated by models learning from prompts and rewards - no example answers needed like in Supervised Fine-Tuning. After the DeepSeek boom, everyone is trying GRPO with GSM8K or the Countdown Game... I wanted a different challenge, like 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀. Choosing an original problem forced me to: 🤔 Think about the problem setting 🧬 Generate data 🤏 Choose the right base model 🏆 Design reward functions (and experiencing reward hacking) 🔄 Run multiple rounds of training, hoping that my model would learn something. A fun and rewarding 😄 experience. I learned a lot of things, that I want to share with you. 👇 ✍️ Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 💻 Code: https://github.com/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 🤗 Hugging Face collection...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 17:20:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/692858936883406</guid></item><item><title>Qwen 3 models released🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/337137510653930</link><description>Qwen 3 models released🔥 It offers 2 MoE and 6 dense models with following parameter sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, 30B(MoE), 32B, and 235B(MoE).

(Qwen2.5 was pre-trained on 18 trillion tokens.) ✅Qwen3 dense models match the performance of larger Qwen2.5 models. For example, Qwen3-1.7B/4B/8B/14B/32B perform like Qwen2.5-3B/7B/14B/32B/72B. ✅ Three stage done while pretraining: • Stage 1: General language learning and knowledge building. • Stage 2: Reasoning boost with STEM, coding, and logic skills. • Stage 3: Long context training ✅ It supports MCP in the model ✅ Strong agent skills ✅ Supports seamless between thinking mode (for hard tasks like math and coding) and non-thinking mode (for fast chatting) inside chat...</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 17:20:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/337137510653930</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the ONNX model explorer: Browse, search, and visualize neural networks directly in your browser. 🤯 A great tool for anyone studying Machine Learning!
