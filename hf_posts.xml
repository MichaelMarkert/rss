Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded &gt;270...</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:25:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495</guid></item><item><title>Say hello to my little friends!

This is Glyph, Zai’s new visual-text compression voodoo: • 10 k words → 3 PNGs ≈ 3 k visual tokens • Compression ratio: 4.3× • Throughput: 40-60 tok/s i.e. your context window now finishes before my coffee does So I did the only reasonable thing: asked GLM-4.6 to port Glyph for Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking. Translation: I made one model compress a novel into a comic strip, then made another model read the comic strip and still ace QA. It’s basically passing notes in class, except the note is a 1920×1080 meme and the teacher is a transformer. We've gone from "Attention is All You Need" to "Attention is Too Expensive, Just Use Your Eyes." Remember kids: in 2025 literacy is optional, but JPEG is forever.

"𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗜𝘀 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱"! 🥳 FineVision: Open Data Is All You Need (2510.17269) If you've ever trained a VLM, you know this problem: nobody shares their data mixtures. It's a black box, making replicating SOTA work impossible. We wanted to change that. FineVision unifies 200 sources into 24 million samples. With 17.3 million images and 9.5 billion answer tokens, it's the largest open resource of its kind. In the paper, we share how we built it: 🔍 finding and cleaning data at scale 🧹 removing excessive duplicates across sources 🤗 decontaminating against 66 public benchmarks My favorite part is Figure 6 (in the video!). It's our visual diversity analysis. It shows that FineVision isn't just bigger; it's more balanced and conceptually richer than other open datasets. NVIDIA's Eagle 2 paper highlighted just how critical this visual diversity is, and our results confirm it: models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on...</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:25:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/792285802244623</guid></item><item><title>🚧 Reproducing LBM-Eraser… in progress! [1]</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/piercus/315056772255613</link><description>🚧 Reproducing LBM-Eraser… in progress! [1] When repurposing a T2I model into a pure I2I model, there’s always that orphaned text path — what do we do with it? 🤔 You can reuse it as learnable embeddings in multi-task setups [2], freeze an empty text prompt, distillate or prune the corresponding part. In LBM, they take a clever route — zeroing [3] and reshaping [4] the text-related cross-attentions into self-attentions. This gives you fresh weights for I2I computation, nicely integrated into your SD architecture. 📎 References [1] Our LBM Fork: https://github.com/finegrain-ai/LBM [2] OmniPaint: OmniPaint: Mastering Object-Oriented Editing via Disentangled Insertion-Removal Inpainting (2503.08677) [3] LBM Zeroing: https://github.com/gojasper/LBM/blob/cafebc46a9ac16dcc61691d289cc4676b5c75380/examples/training/train_lbm_surface.py#L147-L148 [4] LBM Reshaping: https://github.com/gojasper/LBM/blob/cafebc46a9ac16dcc61691d289cc4676b5c75380/examples/training/train_lbm_surface.py#L100 See...</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:25:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/piercus/315056772255613</guid></item><item><title>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal embedding model, ranked first on the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/611899757397292</link><description>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal embedding model, ranked first on the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark 🎉 This model is the product of quite literally months of painstaking work alongside @ abdurrahmanbutler collecting, cleaning, and processing terabytes of data as well as coming up with novel improvements to the standard embedder training recipe to push the limits of what's possible. Kanon 2 Embedder is my most advanced model to date. On MLEB, it benchmarks as 9% more accurate than OpenAI's best embedding model and 30% faster. Even when truncated from 1,792 to 768 dimensions, Kanon 2 Embedder continues to hold the number one spot on MLEB. Importantly, Kanon 2 Embedder is also privacy and security friendly — unlike Voyage, Cohere and Jina, none of your data is used to train our models by default. Kanon 2 Embedder can also be self-hosted for enterprises with heightened security or reliability requirements.
