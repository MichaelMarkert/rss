A few months ago it was just a wild idea I shared with @ bygimenez , now it's real. Dione (Beta) is here, the easiest way to discover and install open-source apps, especially AI ones. Think of it as the Steam of open source. Installing open-source tools is often a mess. Dione fixes that. Beautiful UI and workflow. Soon multi-platform, multilingual &amp; fully open-source. Users can even write and share their own installation scripts. This is just the beginning. 🚀 Join our exclusive Beta → https://getdione.app/beta/join See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:21:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/blaise-tk/108431169603656</guid></item><item><title>✨ We’re live!

Introducing TFrameX, the agentic framework for AI builders. After nights of development, we’re finally open-sourcing TFrameX, a powerful AI agent communication and coordination library. TFrameX lets you: 🤖 Run agents in dynamic flows 🔁 Compose reusable patterns like Sequential, Parallel, Router, and more 🧠 Enable agent-to-agent collaboration and delegation ⚡ Build modular, complex multi-agent systems that just work 👉 GitHub: TFrameX https://github.com/TesslateAI/TFrameX But we didn’t stop there. We also built a sleek visual builder to design, deploy, and debug your agent patterns without writing boilerplate! 🧩 Visual Studio for TFrameX: https://github.com/TesslateAI/Studio If you’re building agent frameworks, LLM tools, or agentic apps, TFrameX gives you the tools to move fast and reason deeply.

Much of a model’s usefulness comes from post-training optimization methods. Here are the main optimization algorithms (both classic and new) in one place: 1. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) -&gt; Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (1707.06347) Clips the probability ratio to prevent the new policy from diverging too far from the old one. It helps keep everything stable 2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) -&gt; Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model (2305.18290) It's a non RL method, where an LM is an implicit reward model. It uses a simple loss to boost the preferred answer’s probability over the less preferred one 3.

Meet UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit, now running natively on Apple Silicon via MLX. The video is of UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit completing the prompt "draw a line from the red circle to the green circle, then open reddit in a new tab" running entirely on MacBook. The video is just a replay, during actual usage it took between 15s to 50s per turn with 720p screenshots (on avg its ~30s per turn), this was also with many apps open so it had to fight for memory at times.
