Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3. VLM - Vision-Language Model (CLIP, Flamingo) -&gt; An Introduction to Vision-Language Modeling...</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 13:36:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/795992300839975</guid></item><item><title>Having an insanely good medical LLM is pointless if it won’t answer your questions!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</link><description>Having an insanely good medical LLM is pointless if it won’t answer your questions! So we’ve made 2 notebook for abliterating any model in order to achieve a good model that will actually help you! The notebooks are made using @ mlabonne ‘s abliteration logic and datasets! Feel free to use them and happy training 😊 https://github.com/dralexlup/LLM-Abliteration See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 13:36:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/zamal/148346638153657</link><description>🚀 Videoxity is live on Hugging Face! 🎞️ A powerful, modular toolkit for intelligent video manipulation and scene editing.

Key capabilities: - AI-powered semantic search for models and datasets - Parameter count analysis via safetensors metadata - Trending content discovery - Find similar models/datasets functionality - 11 tools total for enhanced ecosystem navigation The semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching, understanding context and relationships between different models and datasets. Example query: "Find around 10 reasoning Hugging Face datasets published in 2025 focusing on topics other than maths and science. Show a link and a short summary for each dataset."

I also improved the speech bubbles of the agent so you can see exactly what is going on. As tomorrow is the last day, please try the roundtable and let me know if you miss something and I will try to add it. Also, please like the space if you find my MCP useful.
