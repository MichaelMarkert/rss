Here are 9 fresh policy optimization techniques worth knowing: 1. GSPO: Group Sequence Policy Optimization → Group Sequence Policy Optimization (2507.18071) Shifts from token-level to sequence-level optimization, clipping, and rewarding to capture the full picture and increase stability compared to GRPO. GSPO-token variation also allows token-level fine-tuning. 2. LAPO: Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization → LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (2507.15758) A two-stage RL framework that trains models to adaptively control reasoning length by learning typical solution lengths for shorter and more efficient reasoning. 3. HBPO: Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization → Hierarchical Budget Policy...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:44:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/659752309280422</guid></item><item><title>Explore OCR, Captioning, and Visual Understanding with Cutting-Edge Models on Hugging Face. 🤗🧪</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/591329511468798</link><description>Explore OCR, Captioning, and Visual Understanding with Cutting-Edge Models on Hugging Face. 🤗🧪 I’ve put together a collection of Google Colab notebooks to experiment with some of the most exciting models available on the Hugging Face Hub focused on OCR, image captioning, and visual understanding tasks. [Image-to-Text] / [Image-Text-to-Text] &gt; 📖 OCR-ReportLab-Notebooks : prithivMLmods/OCR-ReportLab-Notebooks These notebooks are built for quick prototyping and run on free T4 GPUs, making them perfect for experimentation, testing ideas, or just exploring what’s possible with modern vision-language models. Note: The experimental notebooks are compiled with models that fit within the T4 GPU (free-tier) limits. More models along with their notebooks will be added over time.

AI's all about the data! 📊📚) The impact of the template will depend on how effectively it establishes a minimum meaningful transparency standard for companies that don't otherwise offer any transparency into their handling of e.g. personal data or (anti?-)competitive practices in commercial licensing - we'll see how those play out as new models are released after August 2nd 👀 In the meantime, I wanted to see how the template works for a fully open-source + commercially viable model, so I filled it out for the SmolLM3 - which my colleagues at Hugging Face earlier this month 🤗 ICYMI, it's fully open-source with 3B parameters and performance matching the best similar-size models (I've switched all my local apps from Qwen3 to it, you should...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:44:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yjernite/544574162514620</guid></item><item><title>🛡️ At Ai4Privacy, our goal is to empower researchers to build a safer AI ecosystem.

Today, we're highlighting crucial research that does just that by exposing a new vulnerability. The paper "Forget to Flourish" details a new model poisoning technique. It's a reminder that as we fine-tune LLMs, our anonymization and privacy strategies must evolve to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy dataset was instrumental in this study. It served two key purposes: Provided a Realistic Testbed: It gave the researchers access to a diverse set of synthetic and realistic PII samples in a safe, controlled environment. Enabled Impactful Benchmarking: It allowed them to measure the actual effectiveness of their data extraction attack, proving it could compromise specific, high-value information. This work reinforces our belief that progress in AI security is a community effort. By providing robust tools for benchmarking, we can collectively identify weaknesses and...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:44:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/228428153197540</guid></item><item><title>🤯 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336</link><description>🤯 241B VLM with apache-2.0 license internlm/Intern-S1 internlm released Intern-S1: multimodal reasoning model based on 235B MoE Qwen3 and 6B InternViT 😍 benchmarks look great (👑 best model ✅ best open model) See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:44:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/838684266814336</guid></item><item><title>Say hello to</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Wauplin/921235032674409</link><description>Say hello to hf : a faster, friendlier Hugging Face CLI ✨ We are glad to announce a long-awaited quality-of-life improvement: the Hugging Face CLI has been officially renamed from huggingface-cli to hf! So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI’s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf &lt;resource&gt; &lt;action&gt;. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember?

TTD-DR applies diffusion-inspired techniques to iteratively refine research reports while grounding them in real web sources. How it works: • Generates initial draft • Identifies knowledge gaps • Searches web for missing info • Iteratively refines through "denoising" steps • Produces comprehensive reports with 15-30+ sources The magic? It works with ANY model so you can choose your favorite open-source models on HF! Key results: - 47 complex research queries tested - Every report backed by real web sources - Quality rivals human research analysts - No more hallucinations on current events!
