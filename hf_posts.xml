With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -&gt; https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -&gt; https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3. WebThinker -&gt; https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/WebThinker Lets reasoning models...</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:21:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/947704683052150</guid></item><item><title>🧠 SOMA: The Core Architecture for AGI Level 1 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/674788441765421</link><description>🧠 SOMA: The Core Architecture for AGI Level 1 🚀 VIDraft/SOMA-AGI 🎯 The First Step Toward AGI SOMA (Self-Orchestrating Modular Architect) is a revolutionary architecture that fulfills the essential requirements for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Level 1. It perfectly implements the common AGI prerequisites emphasized by Yann LeCun (Meta), OpenAI, and Google DeepMind within a single LLM. 📋 AGI Level 1 Core Requirements = SOMA's Perfect Implementation ✅ 🎯 Planning Capability → Supervisor AI autonomously designs and executes comprehensive analysis roadmaps 🧩 Role Differentiation &amp; Modularity → A single LLM instantly differentiates into 5 expert AIs for collaboration 🔄 Self-reflection &amp; Feedback Loops → Evaluator AI continuously validates and directs improvements 🛠️ Tool-use &amp; Autonomy → Full automation from web search to report generation 🎮 Long-term Agency Structure → Completes complex 11-stage collaborative processes end-to-end 🔷 SOMA's Three Core Structures 🧭 Self-...</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:21:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/674788441765421</guid></item><item><title>I find it really annoying that you can use a Zero GPU model that will throw an error but it’ll still take the processing time from your quota.

As of version [5740]( https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b5740 ), llama-quantize now supports layer pruning via the --prune-layers flag! Findings so far are that removing one or two layers has a relatively moderate impact on quality. PPL and KLD suffer quite a lot, as expected considering that pruning changes the logits distribution, but the drop in inference quality, as reflected by tests' scores, is less pronounced. For example, using the Q4_K_M variants as a benchmark, the average drop between eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/gemma-3-12b-it-GGUF is &lt; 3% (60.03 vs 61.65). Similar behaviour for eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-pruned-GGUF and eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF , albeit with a bit higher impact at ~5.5% (54.19 vs 57.36). These results seem to confirm Xin Men's et al ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You Expect (2403.03853) Another interesting side-effect, at least with Qwen3-30B-A3B, is...</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:21:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/163350286978506</guid></item></channel></rss>
