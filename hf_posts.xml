It is an advanced LoRA adaptation of the Qwen-Image model and an upgraded version of prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism , offering more precise portrait rendering with a strong focus on realism. The model was trained on diverse face types from across the world, labeled with florence2-en and caption-optimized using prithivMLmods/DeepCaption-VLA-7B . 11(types) √ó 5 different face types: Asian, Hispanic, Caucasian, Latina, Middle Eastern, etc. ‚Æû Modelü§ó: prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-HeadshotX ‚Æû The Previous Adapter (LoRA): prithivMLmods/Qwen-Image-Studio-Realism ‚Æû Collection: prithivMLmods/qwen-image-exp-lora-68a978fe11400bc3165b0c4d . . .

We can also think of them as software packages, containing data, harness and scoring rules - for the model to learn and be evaluated. Nowadays, the Agent is not just the LLM. It can use tools, from a weather API to a terminal. This makes environments for training and evaluation more complex and critical. 3Ô∏è‚É£ ùêìùê°ùêû ùê®ùê©ùêûùêß ùêúùê°ùêöùê•ùê•ùêûùêßùê†ùêû Big labs...</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:20:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/373269745519376</guid></item></channel></rss>
