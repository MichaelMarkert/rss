My local MacBook Air setup includes a Qwen3 Coder Flash with a 1M context, Cline in a VSCode IDE. No internet, no cloud, no ID verification- this is the forbidden tech. Current stats: All agentic tools work great local, sandboxed, and MCP OK model output precision 17 tokens/sec. Not great, not terrible 65K tokens context, the model can do 1M, but let’s be real, my MacBook Air would probably achieve fusion before hitting that smoothly Standard backend and cache off for the test All inference and function calling happen locally, offline, untethered. The cloud didn’t even get a memo.

With sharper reasoning, better tool use, and expanded capabilities, Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 is now live and ready to impress. 🧠 What Makes Dhanishtha Special? Unlike typical CoT models that only thinks one time, Dhanishtha thinks iteratively: &gt; Think → Answer → Rethink → Improve → Rethink again if needed. 🔗 Try it now: HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 🔞 Dhanishtha NSFW Preview For those exploring more expressive and immersive roleplay scenarios, we’re also releasing: HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-nsfw A specialized version tuned for adult-themed interactions and character-driven roleplay. 🔗 Explore it here: HelpingAI/Dhanishtha-nsfw 💬 You can also try all of these live at chat.helpingai.co See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:35:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/625756342268823</guid></item><item><title>We’re excited to share that Llama Nemotron Super v1.5 -- our latest open reasoning model -- is leading the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index - a leaderboard that spans advanced math, science, and agentic tasks, for models running on a single NVIDIA H100.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/chintankp/680096865746882</link><description>We’re excited to share that Llama Nemotron Super v1.5 -- our latest open reasoning model -- is leading the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index - a leaderboard that spans advanced math, science, and agentic tasks, for models running on a single NVIDIA H100. Super v1.5 is trained with high-quality reasoning synthetic data generated from models like Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek R1. Besides leading accuracy, it also delivers high throughput. Key features: - Leading accuracy on multi-step reasoning, math, coding, and function-calling - Post-trained using RPO, DPO, and RLVR across 26M+ synthetic examples - Fully transparent training data on HF (Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v1) Try Super v1.5 on build.nvidia.com or download from Hugging Face See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:35:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/chintankp/680096865746882</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Camel-Doc-OCR-080125(v2), a document content-structure retrieval VLM designed for content extraction and summarization.
