But can they follow the story?🤔 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!⏳ We test three skills that matter for real-world use: 🔎 Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. 🧩 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. 🏃 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging. We've found the breaking points—now the community can start fixing them.📈 Want to learn more? TimeScope is 100% open-source. Benchmark your model and help us build the next generation of video AI. 📖 Blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/timescope-video-lmm-benchmark 👩‍💻 Leaderboard &amp; Demo: Apollo-LMMs/TimeScope 📊...</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:39:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/542123544707457</guid></item><item><title>It's Qwen3 week! 💜 We uploaded Dynamic 2-bit GGUFs for:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/754522453041743</link><description>It's Qwen3 week! 💜 We uploaded Dynamic 2-bit GGUFs for: Qwen3-Coder: unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF Qwen3-2507: unsloth/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-GGUF So you can run them both locally!

We align the multimodal model using multiple optimization objectives (losses), guided by a preference dataset (chosen vs. rejected multimodal pairs).
