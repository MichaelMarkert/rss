I noticed that model cards usually have Transformers code as usage examples. So I tried to figure out how to load a model just using the transformers library without using ollama, lmstudio, or llamacpp. Learned how to install dependencies required to make it work like pytorch and CUDA. I also used Conda for python environment dependencies. Once I got the model loaded and sample inference working, I made an API to serve it. I know it's very basic stuff for machine learning experts here in HF but I'm completely new to this so I'm happy to get it working! Model used: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Here's the result of my experimentation See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 05:26:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/melvindave/358781763788308</guid></item><item><title>ScalingOpt is continuously evolving!

Our work on modeling data taxonomies led to new approaches for jointly clustering and mixing data distributions under data repetition penalties. Many improvements in our STEM abilities can be traced back to this.
