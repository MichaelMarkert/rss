JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, a self-supervised learning framework that predicts the latent representation of a missing part of the input. Here are 11 JEPA types that you should know about: 1. V-JEPA 2 -&gt; V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning (2506.09985) Trained on 1M+ hours of internet videos and a little bit of robot interaction data, V-JEPA 2 can watch, understand, answer questions, and help robots plan and act in physical world 2. Time-Series-JEPA (TS-JEPA) -&gt; Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks (2406.04853) It's a time-series predictive model that learns compact, meaningful representations. A self-supervised semantic actor then uses them to generate control commands without raw data 3. Denoising JEPA (D-JEPA) -&gt; Denoising...</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:26:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/659118746872319</guid></item><item><title>stop writing CUDA kernels yourself</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/593764353844896</link><description>stop writing CUDA kernels yourself we have launched Kernel Hub: easy optimized kernels for all models on Hugging Face 🔥 use them right away! it's where the community populates optimized kernels 🤝 this release comes in three parts &gt; Kernel Hub: contains (as of now) 14 kernels &gt; kernels: Python library to load kernels from Kernel Hub &gt; kernel-builder: Nix package to build kernels for PyTorch (made using PyTorch C++ frontend) when building models, your regular workflow should be pulling kernels from Hub and building your model with them 🤗 here's a practical example with RMSNorm: 1. pull the kernel from Hub with get_kernel 2. decorate with use_kernel_forward_from_hub 3. inject it to your model we'd love to hear your feedback! 🙏🏻 we also welcome kernel contributions by community 🥹💗 - request kernels here: kernels-community/README#1 - check out this org: kernels-community - read the blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/hello-hf-kernels See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:26:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/593764353844896</guid></item><item><title>🎬 VEO3 Directors - All-in-One AI Video Creation Suite</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/718905723783644</link><description>🎬 VEO3 Directors - All-in-One AI Video Creation Suite 🚀 What is VEO3 Directors?
