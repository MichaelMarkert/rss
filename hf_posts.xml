It’s no longer just about "predicting the next token"—it’s about executing latent plans on a high-speed data highway. What happens when we combine DeepSeek’s stability with Google’s strategic intelligence? 1️⃣ The Infrastructure: DeepSeek’s mHC Moving from a single-lane residual stream to a multi-lane highway. Using the Birkhoff Polytope, mHC ensures mathematical stability (Identity Mapping) while routing specialized data through dedicated lanes. 2️⃣ The Intelligence: Google’s Meta-Controller An internal AI unit that lives inside the Transformer. It escapes the "Token Trap" by extracting data to create a latent plan, steering the model via Temporal Abstraction. The Synergy: In a Topological Transformer, the Meta-Controller finally has the "dedicated lanes" it needs to steer complex reasoning without causing gradient explosions. We aren't just making models bigger; we are...</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:43:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/406965796956131</guid></item><item><title>2025.1  - DeepSeek entered the scene, backed by High Flyer Quant</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/447609737740306</link><description>2025.1 - DeepSeek entered the scene, backed by High Flyer Quant 2026.1 - IQuest enters the game, backed by Uniquant Quant 📈 and launching IQuest-Coder on huggingface https://huggingface.co/collections/IQuestLab/iquest-coder ✨ 40B models: Instruct / Thinking / Loop ✨ Loop = MoE-level performance with only ~5% extra training cost ✨ Native 128K context See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:43:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/447609737740306</guid></item><item><title>The recent update to Meta's ad algorithm is very difficult to crack, and even the latest models struggle to keep up with it.

It's been a crazy year for me! This year I launched VANTA Research as a solo operator and managed to push out 14 original open source finetunes and 5 datasets in the span of about 4 months, completely on my own. The reception has been much higher than I ever anticipated and sincerely appreciate everyone that's checked out my work thus far. The good news is, I'm just getting started! In 2026 you can expect even more original models from VANTA Research, more open source datasets, and maybe some other cool things as well? 👀 2026 is gonna be big for AI in general, and I can't wait to experience it with all of you!

FORTY concurrent clients. That's 609 t/s out, 1492 t/s in. The model outputs fire faster than I can type, but feeds on data like a black hole on cheat day. But wait, there's more! Threw it into Claude Code torture testing with 60+ tools, 8 agents (7 sub-agents because apparently one wasn't enough chaos). It didn't even flinch. Extremely fast, scary good at coding. The kind of performance that makes you wonder if the model's been secretly reading Stack Overflow in its spare time lol 3 months ago, these numbers lived in my "maybe in “2030 dreams. Today it's running on my desk AND heaths my home office during the winter!

Play with it here: 2025-ai-timeline/2025-ai-timeline Here's my personal quarterly TL;DR: 1️⃣ Q1 — Learning to Reason Deepseek not only releases a top-notch reasoning model, but shows how to train them and compete with closed frontier models. OpenAI debuts Deep Research. Significant milestones: DeepSeek R1 &amp; R1-Zero, Qwen 2.5 VL, OpenAI Deep Research, Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) 2️⃣ Q2 — Multimodality and Coding More LLMs embrace multimodality by default, and there's a surge in coding agents. Strong vision, audio, and generative models emerge. Significant milestones: Llama 4, Qwen 3, Imagen 4, OpenAI Codex, Google Jules, Claude 4 3️⃣ Q3 — "Gold" rush, OpenAI opens up, the community goes bananas Flagship models get gold in Math olympiads and hard benchmarks.
