With advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL), machines are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of making decisions autonomously. This shift is having a significant impact on society as we know it. One of the most notable aspects of RL is its ability to learn from experience. By observing and interacting with its surroundings, an AI-driven RL system can adapt to new situations and make decisions based on real-world data. This has huge implications for industries like healthcare, where AI can be used to analyze patient data and provide personalized treatment plans, or finance, where it can help predict market trends and make more informed investment decisions. Furthermore, RL is driving innovation in robotics and automation. Autonomous vehicles, for example, rely on RL to navigate complex environments safely...</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 17:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ghostai1/378992241286931</guid></item><item><title>#CVPR2025 Paper Picks #1</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/840226106342254</link><description>#CVPR2025 Paper Picks #1 VisionZip is a compression technique that reduces number of visual tokens to improve performance AND prefill time for vision language models demo: Senqiao/VisionZip paper: VisionZip: Longer is Better but Not Necessary in Vision Language Models (2412.04467) most of the image tokens are redundant for the LLM, so the authors ask "are all visual tokens necessary?" the method is simple: find which tokens have the highest attention score, merge rest of the tokens based on similarity, then merge both their method is both training-free and for fine-tuning the authors report 5 point improvement on average of vision language tasks + 8x improvement in prefilling time for Llava-Next 7B and 13B ü§Ø removing redundant tokens improve image token quality too ü•π See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 17:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/840226106342254</guid></item><item><title>11 Types of JEPA</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/659118746872319</link><description>11 Types of JEPA Since Meta released the newest V-JEPA 2 this week, we thought it's a good time to revisit a few other interesting JEPA variants. JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, a self-supervised learning framework that predicts the latent representation of a missing part of the input. Here are 11 JEPA types that you should know about: 1. V-JEPA 2 -&gt; V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning (2506.09985) Trained on 1M+ hours of internet videos and a little bit of robot interaction data, V-JEPA 2 can watch, understand, answer questions, and help robots plan and act in physical world 2. Time-Series-JEPA (TS-JEPA) -&gt; Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks (2406.04853) It's a time-series predictive model that learns compact, meaningful representations. A self-supervised semantic actor then uses them to generate control commands without raw data 3.
