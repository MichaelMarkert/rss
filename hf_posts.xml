TL;DR: With MCP (Model Context Protocol), you can expose tools like web search or image generation and connect them directly to LLMs. It’s simple — and surprisingly powerful. pip install "huggingface_hub[mcp]&gt;=0.32.0" We wrote a blog post where we show how to run Tiny Agents, and dive deeper into how they work and how to build your own. 👉 https://huggingface.co/blog/python-tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 05:21:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/celinah/946156020996069</guid></item><item><title>🎉🥳 SOTA!!! 🚀👑</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/484907766797591</link><description>🎉🥳 SOTA!!! 🚀👑 🥇 Claude 4 Opus !!🥇 7 months!! ⌛⌛ I thought the day would never come.

Comparing "pass@1 averaged 10 times" to "normal pass@1" is like grading one student by allowing them to take the test 10 times and averaging question scores, when the other students only get one chance at grading. The first way to grade (avg@10) is actually quite good statistically, much better than what model creators usually report, because models tend to be quite inconsistent - sometimes good, sometimes bad... But! You want to do it for all models then, and report with error bars. The issue is that, if you do... well, it's going to be harder to say your model is the best, because the error bars will overlap between models, by a lot....</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 05:21:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/clefourrier/447221869970447</guid></item><item><title>Uggghhh what a busy week.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/111888750511212</link><description>Uggghhh what a busy week. Been up all night fixing Intellite and I got some progress I wanted to share. ALL errors we experienced (there’s a lot): Gradient vanishing (AI dies) Gradient explosion (AI barely learns and destabilizes) Activation Explosion (AI dies) Layer Scale Crushing Signal (AI dies) Activation Explosion (again) (AI dies) All fixed, but now it keeps overfitting on datasets due to a dataset handler error 😩 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 05:21:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/111888750511212</guid></item><item><title>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 60+ ⭐️ now!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/971729248373235</link><description>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 60+ ⭐️ now!
