This week Hugging Face learn has a whole pathway on finetuning for agentic applications. You can follow these two courses to get knowledge on levelling up your agent game beyond prompts: 1️⃣ New Supervised Fine-tuning unit in the NLP Course https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter11/1 2️⃣New Finetuning for agents bonus module in the Agents Course https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/bonus-unit1/introduction Fine-tuning will squeeze everything out of your model for how you’re using it, more than any prompt.

Last year, their GOT-OCR 2.0 took the community by storm 🔥but many didn’t know they were also building some amazing models. Now, they’ve just dropped something huge on the hub! 📺 Step-Video-T2V: a 30B bilingual open video model that generates 204 frames (8-10s) at 540P resolution with high information density &amp; consistency. stepfun-ai/stepvideo-t2v 🔊 Step-Audio-TTS-3B : a TTS trained with the LLM-Chat paradigm on a large synthetic dataset, capable of generating RAP &amp; Humming stepfun-ai/step-audio-67b33accf45735bb21131b0b See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 09:22:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/709023807759284</guid></item><item><title>Dino: The Minimalist Multipurpose Chat System 🌠</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/874083632338295</link><description>Dino: The Minimalist Multipurpose Chat System 🌠 Agent-Dino : prithivMLmods/Agent-Dino By default, it performs the following tasks: {Text-to-Text Generation}, {Image-Text-Text Generation} @image : Generates an image using Stable Diffusion xL. @3d : Generates a 3D mesh. @web : Web search agents. @rAgent : Initiates a reasoning chain using Llama mode for coding explanations. @tts1-♀ , @tts2-♂ : Voice generation (Female and Male voices).

It seems not. Researchers from Shanghai Jiaotong University just demonstrated that carefully selected examples can boost math performance in large language models using SFT —no huge datasets or RL procedures needed. Their procedure allows Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to jump from 6.5% to 57% on AIME and from 59% to 95% on MATH, while using only 1% of the data in previous approaches. ⚡ The Less-is-More Reasoning Hypothesis: ‣ Minimal but precise examples that showcase optimal reasoning patterns matter more than sheer quantity ‣ Pre-training knowledge plus sufficient computational resources at inference levels up math skills ➡️ Core techniques: ‣ High-quality reasoning chains with self-verification steps ‣ 817 handpicked problems that encourage deeper reasoning ‣ Enough inference-time computation to allow...</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 09:22:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/436586297766836</guid></item><item><title>🚀 FLUX Workflow Canvas</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/141662077994282</link><description>🚀 FLUX Workflow Canvas Welcome to Workflow Canvas, your ultimate AI-driven platform for crafting stunning design concepts and intricate workflow diagrams that empower your business! 🤖✨ ginigen/Workflow-Canvas Features Product Design 🛠️ Transform your ideas into reality with sleek, industrial product designs that blend modern aesthetics with advanced technology.

It was developed by Microsoft Research in collaboration with Ninja Theory (Hellblade developer). It’s built on something called the World and Human Action Model (WHAM-1.6B model). They trained on 7 years of Bleeding Edge gameplay and it can generate 2 minute long 3D game sequences with consistent physics and character behaviors all from just a second of input. They’ve gone and open-sourced it too. Open weights, the WHAM Demonstrator, and sample data on Azure AI Foundry for anyone to play with.
