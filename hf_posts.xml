I've been busy working on some new ranking/position methodologies and excited to start sharing some results. Plot legends: - X = truncation rate (low = good) - ? = confusion rate (low = good) - blue bars = average completion tokens (low = good) - black diamonds = CI-banded performance (high = good) - cluster squares = models inside this group are equivalent openai/gpt-oss-120b remains the king in all dimensions of interest: truncation rates, completion lengths and performance. If I had but one complaint it's the reason_effort does not seem to actually work - more on this soon. Second is a 3-way tie in performance between the Qwen3-235B-2507 we all know and love with an unexpected entrant - ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct This is a very capable model and it's reasoning effort controls actually works, but you should absolutely not leave it on the default "unlimited" - enable a sensible limit (4k works well for 8k context length). Third place is another 3-way...</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 09:29:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mike-ravkine/983643024828039</guid></item><item><title>Anonymizing a prompt is half the battle.

Reliably de-anonymizing the response is the other. To build a truly reliable privacy pipeline, you have to test it. A new Master's thesis does just that, and our data was there for every step. We're excited to showcase this work on handling confidential data in LLM prompts from Nedim Karavdic at Mälardalen University. To build their PII anonymization pipeline, they first trained a custom NER model. We're proud that the Ai4Privacy pii-masking-200k dataset was used as the foundational training data for this critical first step. But it didn't stop there. The research also used our dataset to create the parallel data needed to train and test the generative "Seek" models for de-anonymization. It's a win-win when our open-source data not only helps build the proposed "better solution" but also helps prove why it's better by enabling a rigorous, data-driven comparison. 🔗 Check out the full thesis for a great deep-dive into building a practical, end-...</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 09:29:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/647817712633860</guid></item><item><title>As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049</link><description>As 2025 is ending i would like to thank everyone for trying out Reubencf/Nano_Banana_Editor looking forward to build and release more in the future for the open source community See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 09:29:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/502627640855049</guid></item><item><title>gRPC support in Voiden</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/444530398664756</link><description>gRPC support in Voiden gRPC has become a popular choice for building high-performance, scalable APIs, especially in microservices and real-time systems. Unlike traditional REST APIs, gRPC uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers to deliver fast, efficient communication with strong typing and contract enforcement. Many developers in our community asked for it, so we have now added gRPC support in the latest Voiden release.You can now test and document gRPC APIs side-by-side with your REST and WebSocket APIs. Keep everything in one file-centric, Git-native workflow. Use reusable blocks and version control for gRPC requests, just like any other API call.

What is Git GUI, and how does it help here ? Git GUI makes version control visual, predictable, and easier to reason about especially when things go wrong. That’s exactly why we built Git GUI in Voiden. Instead of relying on memorized commands, Voiden lets you see what Git is doing before it does it. What Voiden’s Git GUI helps developers do • View exact file and line-level changes before committing • Stage only intended changes (no accidental commits) • Clearly distinguish staged vs unstaged files • Inspect visual diffs with full context • Understand branches, commit history, and repo state instantly When Git behavior is hidden, errors increase. Voiden’s Git GUI doesn’t abstract Git away, it explains Git. Whether you’re new to Git or an experienced developer who prefers clarity, this is Git you can reason about. Version control should feel safe, not stressful. What Git pain points slow you down today?...</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 09:29:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/142145591956765</guid></item><item><title>How to Use SwarmUI Presets &amp; Workflows in ComfyUI + Custom Model Paths Setup for ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/729956870553821</link><description>How to Use SwarmUI Presets &amp; Workflows in ComfyUI + Custom Model Paths Setup for ComfyUI &amp; SwarmUI : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s Full tutorial link &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s Info Generating workflow inside SwarmUI and using in ComfyUI is literally 1-click.

AI systems need to remember past interactions, update knowledge, stay consistent over time, and work beyond a single prompt. That's why many start to talk more about memory in AI. Here’s a useful set of studies and videos on where AI memory stands today: 1. Memory in the Age of AI Agents (2512.13564) A great survey that organizes agent memory research. It gives concrete taxonomies across memory form, function, and dynamics, summarizes benchmarks, frameworks, and emerging directions for building systematic agent memory systems 2.When Will We Give AI True Memory? A conversation with Edo Liberty, CEO and founder @ Pinecone -&gt; https://youtu.be/ITbwVFZYepc?si=_lAbRHciC740dNz0 Edo Liberty discusses what real memory in LLMs requires beyond RAG - from scalable vector storage to reliable knowledge systems - and why storage, not compute, is becoming the key bottleneck for...</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 09:29:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/637856294883643</guid></item></channel></rss>
