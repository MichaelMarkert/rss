They provide a full overview of endpoints, methods, parameters etc. which makes working with APIs easier and more consistent. Voiden lets you turn your OpenAPI spec into organized, ready-to-use API request files. Just import your OpenAPI file, and you can immediately browse your endpoints, grouped by tags, and start testing without any manual setup. The generated requests come pre-configured but fully editable, so you can customize them as you want. If you want to get started with your existing APIs or try out new ones, this can save you quite some time.

Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring...</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:35:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jiaqi-hkust/177996283057314</guid></item><item><title>Time-Effective LLM Querying in Information Retrieval Tasks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/476967281276279</link><description>Time-Effective LLM Querying in Information Retrieval Tasks 🎤 Last week at Research Colloquium in Technische Universität Chemnitz, we presented a framework for time-effective data handling with prompting schemas.

We release: 67,000+ trajectories from 3,800 resolved issues in 1,800+ Python repos. About 3x more successful trajectories and 1.5x more repos than our previous dataset. Trajectories are long: on average 64 turns, up to 100 turns and 131k context length. &gt; RFT on this data, SWE-bench Verified: Qwen3-30B-Instruct: 25.7% → 50.3% Pass@1. Qwen3-235B-Instruct: 46.2% → 61.7% Pass@1. Also strong gains on SWE-rebench September. &gt; We also did massive evals. We run OpenHands with 100 and 500 turns. We compare models under both limits. We run on SWE-bench Verified and several months of SWE-rebench. !!! We also check tests written by the models. We measure how often tests are correct. We check how often the final patch passes its own tests. This gives a pool of tests for verifiers and auto graders. &gt; Fully permissive licenses Dataset and models: https://huggingface.co/collections/nebius/openhands-trajectories Blog post:...</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:35:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ibragim-bad/331533607628990</guid></item><item><title>geofractal getting started guide available, bulk ablation for fusion, simple towers, oscillator capacity, and substructure systemic associative capacity.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AbstractPhil/420221970831752</link><description>geofractal getting started guide available, bulk ablation for fusion, simple towers, oscillator capacity, and substructure systemic associative capacity.

All of them either coalesce into the correct behavior or the failures are directly visible, which means the system is robust enough to declare some tools functionally valid but not scalable yet. ai-crash course available; https://github.com/AbstractEyes/geofractal/blob/main/ai_helpers/v101_claude_helpers.txt Feed GPT, Claude, or Grokk and they will assist. getting started guide; https://github.com/AbstractEyes/geofractal/blob/main/src/geofractal/router/GETTING_STARTED.md geofractal router architecture is in prototype phases; https://github.com/AbstractEyes/geofractal This is likely one of it's final growing phases before full production capacity is ramped up.

A recurring lesson from production AI deployments is that most failures are system failures, not model failures. As organizations move beyond pilots, challenges increasingly shift toward: • Agent identity and permissioning • Trust boundaries between agents and human operators • Governance and auditability for autonomous actions • Security treated as a first-class architectural constraint This recent Fortune article highlights how enterprises are navigating that transition, including work with AWS’s AI Innovation Lab. Open question for the community: What architectural patterns or tooling are proving effective for managing identity, permissions, and safety in autonomous or semi-autonomous agent systems in production?
