He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference. As a thank you to the community, he shared 100 invite code first-come first serve, just use “HUGGINGFACE” to get access!

With the latest release of smolagents, you can now securely execute Python code in sandboxed Docker or E2B environments. 🦾🔒 Here's why this is a game-changer for agent-based systems: 🧵👇 1️⃣ Security First 🔐 Running AI agents in unrestricted Python environments is risky! With sandboxing, your agents are isolated, preventing unintended file access, network abuse, or system modifications. 2️⃣ Deterministic &amp; Reproducible Runs 📦 By running agents in containerized environments, you ensure that every execution happens in a controlled and predictable setting—no more environment mismatches or dependency issues! 3️⃣ Resource Control &amp; Limits 🚦 Docker and E2B allow you to enforce CPU, memory, and execution time limits, so rogue or inefficient agents don’t spiral out of control. 4️⃣ Safer Code Execution in Production 🏭 Deploy AI agents confidently, knowing that any generated code runs in an ephemeral, isolated environment, protecting your host machine and...</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 13:18:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/674737128301579</guid></item><item><title>📢 For those who interested in quick extraction of emotion causes in dialogues, below is a notebook that adopts the pre-trained Flan-T5 model on FRIENDS dataset powered by bulk-chain framework:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/947679817144983</link><description>📢 For those who interested in quick extraction of emotion causes in dialogues, below is a notebook that adopts the pre-trained Flan-T5 model on FRIENDS dataset powered by bulk-chain framework: https://gist.github.com/nicolay-r/c8cfe7df1bef0c14f77760fa78ae5b5c Why it might be intersted to check?
