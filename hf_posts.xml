For any AI agent, internet search 🔎 is an important tool. However, with APIs like Tavily and Exa, it becomes really difficult to keep up with the cost. In some cases, these Internet APIs cost more than the LLM. To solve, this, I am making a playwright wrapper API on top of publicly available searXNG instances. This will enable agent applications to fetch internet results for free. Currently, I have set up a basic GitHub repo, and I will continue developing advanced search features, such as image search 🖼️ Github: https://github.com/HanzlaJavaid/Free-Search/tree/main 🚀 Try the deployed version: https://freesearch.replit.app/docs If you find this useful, consider starring ⭐️ the GitHub repository to support further development!

Since token order matters, RoPE encodes it by rotating token embeddings based on their position, so the model knows how to interpret which token comes first, second, and so on. Here are 8 types of RoPE that can be implemented in different cases: 1. Original RoPE -&gt; RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (2104.09864) Encodes token positions by rotating token embeddings in the complex plane via a position-based rotation matrix, thereby providing the self-attention mechanism with relative positional info. 2. LongRoPE -&gt; LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens (2402.13753) Extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to 2048k tokens, leveraging non-uniformities in positional interpolation with an efficient search. 3. LongRoPE2 -&gt; LongRoPE2: Near-Lossless LLM Context Window Scaling (2502.20082) Extends the effective context window of...</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:30:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/498106595218801</guid></item><item><title>So many open releases at Hugging Face past week 🤯 recapping all here ⤵️</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/746832157330905</link><description>So many open releases at Hugging Face past week 🤯 recapping all here ⤵️ merve/march-21-releases-67dbe10e185f199e656140ae 👀 Multimodal &gt; Mistral AI released a 24B vision LM, both base and instruction FT versions, sota 🔥 (OS) &gt; with IBM we released SmolDocling, a sota 256M document parser with Apache 2.0 license (OS) &gt; SpatialLM is a new vision LM that outputs 3D bounding boxes, comes with 0.5B (QwenVL based) and 1B (Llama based) variants &gt; SkyWork released SkyWork-R1V-38B, new vision reasoning model (OS) 💬 LLMs &gt; NVIDIA released new Nemotron models in 49B and 8B with their post-training dataset &gt; LG released EXAONE, new reasoning models in 2.4B, 7.8B and 32B &gt; Dataset: Glaive AI released a new reasoning dataset of 22M+ examples &gt; Dataset: NVIDIA released new helpfulness dataset HelpSteer3 &gt; Dataset: OpenManusRL is a new agent dataset based on ReAct framework (OS) &gt; Open-R1 team released OlympicCoder, new competitive coder model in 7B and 32B &gt; Dataset: GeneralThought-430K is a new...</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:30:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/746832157330905</guid></item><item><title>I shared my view on Qwen vs DeepSeek (student vs genius), and I forgot to mention this: they are neighbors in the same city.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/124053264899473</link><description>I shared my view on Qwen vs DeepSeek (student vs genius), and I forgot to mention this: they are neighbors in the same city. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:30:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/124053264899473</guid></item><item><title>Implemented a custom multimodal GRPO trainer that scales for Small VLMs, supports cpu and gpu with vllm + flash attention.

The results are average of 5 executions. The system varies (different motherboard and CPU ... but that probably that has little effect on the inference performance). https://devquasar.com/gpu-gguf-inference-comparison/ the exact models user are in the page I'd welcome results from other GPUs is you have access do anything else you've need in the post.
