I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation‚Äîon just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt‚Äìresponse pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn‚Äôt turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands ‚ÄúOh great, another meeting‚Äù exactly as you mean it.

It's smarter, faster, and now understands 119 languages instead of just 29. It can do both deep reasoning and quick answers using a single model, depending on what you need. The models range in size from small (0.6B) to huge (235B), with smart ways to save compute. It's trained on 36 trillion tokens and fine-tuned in four steps to boost performance. Qwen3 performs as well as or better than many top models, including some from big companies. It‚Äôs fully open-source under licence.

The model is built based on SigLIP2-400M and MiniCPM4-3B, with a total of 4.1B parameters. It inherits the strong single-image, multi-image, and video understanding performance of MiniCPM-V 2.6 with largely improved efficiency. ‚ú® With only 4.1B parameters, MiniCPM-V 4.0 achieves an average score of 69.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. This performance surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414, MiniCPM-V 2.6 (8.1B parameters, OpenCompass 65.2), and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3.8B parameters, OpenCompass 64.5). It also shows good performance in multi-image and video understanding. The community GPU grant was given by Hugging Face ‚Äî special thanks to them. ü§óüöÄ To know more about it, visit the model card of the respective model. !!
