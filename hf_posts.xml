It doesn't update the full model, it adds small trainable components, low-rank matrices, while keeping the original weights frozen. Only these adapters are trained. Recently, many interesting new LoRA variations came out, so it’s a great time to take a look at these 13 clever approaches: 1. T-LoRA → T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting (2507.05964) A timestep-dependent LoRA method for adapting diffusion models with a single image. It dynamically adjusts updates and uses orthogonal initialization to reduce overlap, achieving better fidelity–alignment balance than standard LoRA 2. SingLoRA → SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix (2507.05566) Simplifies LoRA by using only one small matrix instead of usual two, and multiplying it by its own transpose (like A × Aᵀ). It uses half the parameters of LoRA and avoids scale mismatch between...</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 17:23:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/384482543815919</guid></item><item><title>in case you didn’t know, Claude now has a developer training course with certificates,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/850768471232119</link><description>in case you didn’t know, Claude now has a developer training course with certificates, this is better than anything you can find on Coursera. covers Claude Code, MCP and its advanced topics and even more: https://www.anthropic.com/learn/build-with-claude See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 17:23:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/850768471232119</guid></item><item><title>🎯 Excited to share my comprehensive deep dive into VisionScout's multimodal AI architecture, now published as a three-part series on Towards Data Science!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/760622875415705</link><description>🎯 Excited to share my comprehensive deep dive into VisionScout's multimodal AI architecture, now published as a three-part series on Towards Data Science! This isn't just another computer vision project. VisionScout represents a fundamental shift from simple object detection to genuine scene understanding, where four specialized AI models work together to interpret what's actually happening in an image. 🏗️ Part 1: Architecture Foundation How careful system design transforms independent models into collaborative intelligence through proper layering and coordination strategies. ⚙️ Part 2: Deep Technical Implementation The five core algorithms powering the system: dynamic weight adjustment, attention mechanisms, statistical methods, lighting analysis, and CLIP's zero-shot learning. 🌍 Part 3: Real-World Validation Concrete case studies from indoor spaces to cultural landmarks, demonstrating how integrated systems deliver insights no single model could achieve.

I started a series of Blogs on this! Why a series of Blogs 😝? I want to try to make everyone understand what Bourbaki (7b) is and what it does. I don't want to just give you a ChatGPT summary with some result hype. I think there are many things to improve, and I am hoping with more exposure to this, beyond experiments and codes, some people would be interested and help us improve it! In this first blog, we will be talking basics: 1) MCTS and why it should be applied to LLMs so that the whole world is not just fine-tuning a 100000000000000000000000 b model on 10 data points (not that i have not done it before 🤪🤪), 2) the basics of MDPs, and 3) the Vanilla MCTS algorithm.

You may have to change the prompt a bit to suite the video you upload but it seems to semi work. If anyone knows a better way to fix this, I really wanted to use this for a project but I can’t seem to figure it out.
