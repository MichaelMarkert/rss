Relying on cloud-hosted LLMs is often overkill. While frontier models still lead in complex coding, local models are now more than capable of handling many agentic workflows—with zero latency and total privacy. To help bridge the gap between local inference and usable agents, I’m releasing agent.cpp: https://github.com/mozilla-ai/agent.cpp It provides minimal, high-performance building blocks for agents in C++, built directly around the awesome llama.cpp ecosystem. Stop sending your data to a remote API. Start building and running agents on your own hardware.

Instead of only matching surface-level preferences, the system now implements a multi-dimensional semantic reasoning architecture that emphasizes real-life compatibility and risk awareness. Key technical improvements: - SBERT-powered semantic understanding with dynamic weight allocation across six constraint dimensions (space, activity, noise, grooming, experience, family) - Hierarchical constraint management distinguishing critical safety constraints from flexible preferences, with progressive relaxation when needed -Multi-head scoring system combining semantic matching (15%), lifestyle compatibility (70%), constraint adherence (10%), and confidence calibration (5%) -Intelligent risk filtering that applies graduated penalties (-10% to...</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/213826857024975</guid></item><item><title>Introducing demos for new SOTA models from AI2: SAGE-MM (Smart Any-Horizon Agents for Long-Video Reasoning) and Molmo-2, an open vision-language model that supports multi-image (QA and pointing) and video (QA, pointing, and tracking).

I've discovered that my repository John1604/Kimi-K2-Thinking-q6K-gguf isn't getting enough downloads and is nearly consuming 1TB of storage. While I love Kimi K2's way of thinking, I have to delete this model because it's a true open-source 1TB LLM, comparable to any cutting-edge LLM model. In the AI ​​race, four US companies have 1TB+ models: xAI, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. China also has four companies with 1TB+ models: Alibaba, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GLM. Currently, the two sides are evenly matched. Only American team and Chinese team have LLM with 1T+ parameters. Let's cheer for them to reach AGI in next 5 to 10 years. Maybe a 64T chinese model will do it -- Human and cat brain...</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/712509372180068</guid></item><item><title>Introducing PTS Visualizer - an interactive tool for exploring how language models reason!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/327583349449116</link><description>Introducing PTS Visualizer - an interactive tool for exploring how language models reason!

The next year is going to be a year of context engineering which expands beyond prompt engineering. The two complement each other: prompt engineering shapes how we ask, while context engineering shapes what the model knows, sees, and can do. To keep things clear, here are the main techniques and design patterns in both areas, with some useful resources for further exploration: ▪️ 9 Prompt Engineering Techniques (configuring input text) 1. Zero-shot prompting – giving a single instruction without examples. Relies entirely on pretrained knowledge. 2. Few-shot prompting – adding input–output examples to encourage model to show the desired behavior. ⟶ https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 3. Role prompting – assigning a persona or role (e.g. "You are a senior researcher," "Say it as a specialist in...</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/746586334382009</guid></item><item><title>Wan 2.2 Complete Training Tutorial - Text to Image, Text to Video, Image to Video, Windows &amp; Cloud :</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/210519935872315</link><description>Wan 2.2 Complete Training Tutorial - Text to Image, Text to Video, Image to Video, Windows &amp; Cloud : https://youtu.be/ocEkhAsPOs4 Wan 2.2 training is now so easy.
