Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on "1 million W200 GPUs," hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack. Samsung Electronics appears to be unaware of this situation, as they have not taken any visible...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 13:35:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</guid></item><item><title>Eyyy thank you guys for 40 followers!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/814105476165639</link><description>Eyyy thank you guys for 40 followers!

Sometimes, a single agent isn't enough — a team of simpler, specialized agents working together to solve a task can be a much better option. Building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) isn’t easy, that's why today we’re offering you a list of sources that may help you master MAS: 1. CrewAI tutorials -&gt; https://docs.crewai.com/introduction#ready-to-start-building%3F At the end of the page you'll find a guide on how to build a crew of agents that research and analyze a topic, and create a report. Also, there are useful guides on how to build a single CrewAI agent and a workflow 2. Building with CAMEL multi-agent framework -&gt; https://github.com/camel-ai/camel Offers guides, cookbooks and other useful information to build even million agent societies, explore and work with MAS 3.
