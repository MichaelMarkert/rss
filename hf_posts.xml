To make a research survey, you generally follow two steps, preparation (collect and organize papers) and writing (outline creation, writing, polishing). Researchers followed the same two steps and automated them. üéØ For the preparation part, a key part is find all the important references on the given subject. Researchers first cast a wide net of all relevant papers. But then finding the really important ones is like distilling knowledge from a haystack of information. To solve this challenge, they built an ‚ÄúAttributeTree‚Äù object that structures key information from citations. Ablating these AttributeTrees significantly decreased structure and...</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 05:20:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/788543954757847</guid></item><item><title>Datasets Convertor üöÄ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/251902401084370</link><description>Datasets Convertor üöÄ openfree/Datasets-Convertor Welcome to Datasets Convertor, the cutting-edge solution engineered for seamless and efficient data format conversion.

Been testing all these tools myself and created a searchable collection of the most practical ones - from audio transcription to image generation to document analysis. No coding needed, no expensive subscriptions. Some highlights I've tested personally: - Private, on-device transcription with speaker ID in 100+ languages using Whisper - Website scraping that just works - paste a URL, get structured data - Local image editing with tools like Finegrain (impressive results) - Document chat using Qwen 2.5 72B (handles technical papers well) Sharing this early because the best tools come from the community. Drop your favorite tools in the comments or join the discussion on what to add next! üëâ JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 05:20:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/982146976081521</guid></item><item><title>Getting WebRTC and Websockets right in python is very tricky.

Yes, just four. This is a simple one, and its recipe is fully open: sometimesanotion/Lamarck-14B-v0.7-Fusion It unifies three branches, all of which feature models which bring Lamarck-14B-v0.7 and Qwenvergence-14B-v12-Prose together. One side features @ jpacifico 's jpacifico/Chocolatine-2-14B-Instruct-v2.0.3 and the other features @ suayptalha 's suayptalha/Lamarckvergence-14B paired with my models which were their merge ancestors. A fusion merge - of a fusion merge and a SLERP of a fusion and older merge - should demonstrate the new merge method's behavior in interesting ways, especially in the first 1/4th of the model where the SLERP has less impact. I welcome you to kick the tires and learn from it. It has prose quality near Qwenvergence v12's - as you'd expect.
