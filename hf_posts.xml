This article introduces a structural solution to the self-reference problem inside the Cosmic Intelligence Model (CIM). By applying rollback, reflexive loops, and parse-guard boundaries, self-observation becomes not a trap, but a verifiable procedure. &gt; Self-reference isn’t a dead end — &gt; it is structure folding back to secure itself. --- Why It Matters: • Addresses a classical unsolved issue in logic and epistemology • Ensures that intelligence can audit itself without infinite regress • Provides the foundation for safe AGI self-modeling --- *What’s Inside: • The paradox of “intelligence inside its own frame” • Protocolic safeguards: rollback, reflexia,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:22:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/177441058390986</guid></item><item><title>6 Recent &amp; free sources to master Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/121549643934542</link><description>6 Recent &amp; free sources to master Reinforcement Learning Almost every week new research and resources on RL come out. Knowledge needs to be constantly refreshed and updated with the latest trends. So today, we’re sharing 6 free sources to help you stay on track with RL: 1. A Survey of Continual Reinforcement Learning → https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21872 Covers continual RL (CRL): how agents can keep learning and adapt to new tasks without forgetting past ones. It analyses methods, benchmarks, evaluation metrics &amp;challenges 2. The Deep Reinforcement Learning course by Hugging Face → https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction This is a popular free course, regularly updated. Includes community interaction, exercises, leaderboards, etc. 3. Reinforcement Learning Specialization (Coursera, University of Alberta) → https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning A 4-course series introducing foundational RL, implementing different algorithms, culminating...</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:22:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/121549643934542</guid></item><item><title>🌱 Darwin-Qwen3-4B Released!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/257915517364698</link><description>🌱 Darwin-Qwen3-4B Released! We are excited to introduce the first achievement of the Darwin Project. We have evolved an embryonic model that simultaneously inherits the strengths of both non-reasoning models and reasoning models based on Qwen3-4B, creating a new offspring model. openfree/Darwin-Qwen3-4B ✅ Benchmarking results confirm that the traits and advantages of both parent models are fully reflected. ✅ We are releasing Darwin-Qwen3-4B on Hugging Face. 🔬 Technical Specifications Model Configuration -Base Architecture: Qwen3-4B -Parent Model 1: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 -Parent Model 2: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 -Merge Algorithm: Darwin A2AP Enhanced v3.2 -Optimization Method: Evolutionary Algorithm with Adaptive Fitness Evolution Process -Population Size: 20 individuals -Evolution Cycles: 5,000+ generations -Fitness Objectives: Multi-objective optimization (accuracy, robustness, generalization) -Validation Metric: 88.56% on proxy task (digit classification) 📊 Technical...</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:22:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/257915517364698</guid></item></channel></rss>
