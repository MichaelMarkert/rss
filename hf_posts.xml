His model achieved perfect real-world detection accuracy without a single real image in the training loop. In this blog, Dr. Sanz walks us through his method, which includes the design and training of an advanced pipeline to achieve 100% detection accuracy. His full technical breakdown covers: 📍 Synthetic-only training 📍 Data augmentation with an ensemble learning approach for better generalization 📍 Custom occlusion generation 📍 A Faster R-CNN model fine-tuned with Falcon generated data 📍 And much more! The results speak for themselves! 📖 Read the blog here: https://www.duality.ai/blog/leveraging-synthetic-data-for-real-world-object-detection Congratulations Sergio!

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/ε²) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, ε = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/ε) examples (where d = input...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:27:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125</guid></item><item><title>Started</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/954423414183854</link><description>Started aistatuscodes as a new project to create codes to understand AI performance better.

JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, a self-supervised learning framework that predicts the latent representation of a missing part of the input. Here are 11 JEPA types that you should know about: 1. V-JEPA 2 -&gt; V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning (2506.09985) Trained on 1M+ hours of internet videos and a little bit of robot interaction data, V-JEPA 2 can watch, understand, answer questions, and help robots plan and act in physical world 2. Time-Series-JEPA (TS-JEPA) -&gt; Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks (2406.04853) It's a time-series predictive model that learns compact, meaningful representations. A self-supervised semantic actor then uses them to generate control commands without raw data 3.
