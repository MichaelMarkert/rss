Despite the costs, the performance makes it a valuable investment, especially in critical applications where translation quality is paramount. Now we can say that Europe is more than imposing regulations. Our dataset, based on these comparisons, is now available on Hugging Face. This might be useful for anyone working on AI translation or language model evaluation.

Then we can use that to measure misinformation in other AI. https://huggingface.co/blog/etemiz/building-a-beneficial-ai See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:28:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/135866882319158</guid></item><item><title>😊 This program is designed to remove emojis from a given text. It uses a regular expression (regex) pattern to match and replace emojis with an empty string, effectively removing them from the text. The pattern includes a range of Unicode characters that correspond to various types of emojis, such as emoticons, symbols, and flags. By using this program, you can clean up text data by removing any emojis that may be present, which can be useful for text processing, analysis, or other applications where emojis are not desired. 💻</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/aifeifei798/845431141575759</link><description>😊 This program is designed to remove emojis from a given text.

I experimented with different recipes and improved the abliteration technique I wrote about last year. It's still experimental but the refusal rate is super low in my tests.

Recently, we launched a waitlist to join the movement to Xet (join here! https://huggingface.co/join/xet ) but getting to this point was a journey. From the initial proof of concept in August, to launching on the Hub internally, to migrating a set of repositories and routing a small chunk of download traffic on the Hub through our infrastructure. Every step of the way has been full of challenges, big and small, and well worth the effort. Over the past few weeks, with real traffic flowing through our services we’ve tackled some truly gnarly issues (unusual upload/download patterns, memory leaks, load imbalances, and more) and resolved each without major disruptions. If you're curious about how this sliver of Hub infrastructure looks as we routed traffic through it for the first time (and want a deep dive full...</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:28:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/922959392704733</guid></item></channel></rss>
