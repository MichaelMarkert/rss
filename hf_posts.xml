Well.. you can run MuJoCo inside a Hugging Face space! All you have to do is to clone this space: jbilcke-hf/train-robots-with-mujoco Don't forget to a pick a Nvidia GPU for your space, to be able to get some nice OpenGL renders! Are you new to MuJoCo and/or JupyterLab notebooks?

The current model places impossible burdens on users to manage countless consent decisions. Meanwhile, AI systems learn to mimic our voices and writing styles from data we unknowingly provided years ago. What's next? We need to shift from individual responsibility to collective accountability. This means: - Organizations designing systems that respect human agency by default - Developers building ethics into models from the start - Policymakers creating frameworks beyond minimal compliance Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/consentful-ai Paper: Can AI be Consentful?
