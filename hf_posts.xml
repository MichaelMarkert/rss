In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. 📤 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt; are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is &lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|user|&gt;. 📏 Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 09:22:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752</guid></item><item><title>Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729</link><description>Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! 🎉 Follow me for more @ ronantakizawa See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 09:22:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729</guid></item><item><title>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/evalstate/865812476358807</link><description>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New!
