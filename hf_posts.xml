Accepted values: - auto (future default) - medium - large (current default) The auto mode checks total CUDA tensor size during startup: - More than 30GB → large - Otherwise → medium See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:35:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/cbensimon/356529804559377</guid></item><item><title>🎮 Vibe Game Craft: Create Your Own Web Games Through Multi-LLM and Agent Collaboration for Free ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/503727691158505</link><description>🎮 Vibe Game Craft: Create Your Own Web Games Through Multi-LLM and Agent Collaboration for Free ✨ Hello, game development enthusiasts!

Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on "1 million W200 GPUs," hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack. Samsung Electronics appears to be unaware of this situation, as they have not taken any visible...</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:35:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</guid></item><item><title>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 50+ ⭐️ now!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/496966036460471</link><description>Curated list of **Next Gen Code Generation** papers &amp; benchmarks! 🔥 with 50+ ⭐️ now!

We just released a guide on creating human trajectory datasets with C/ua Okay, so you’ve gotten your environment up and also tested a few agent runs. You’ll likely have encountered cases where your agent was successful at doing some tasks but also places where it got stuck or outright failed. Now what? If you’ve ever wondered exactly what your computer agent is doing and why it sometimes doesn’t do what you expected, then the Trajectory Viewer for C/ua is here to help! Whether you’re a seasoned developer or someone who just wants to dive in and see results, this tool makes it easy to explore every step your agent takes on your screen. Plus, if you want to start thinking about generating data to train your own agentic model (we’ll cover training in an upcoming blog, so look forward to it), then our Trajectory Viewer might be for you.

Sometimes, a single agent isn't enough — a team of simpler, specialized agents working together to solve a task can be a much better option. Building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) isn’t easy, that's why today we’re offering you a list of sources that may help you master MAS: 1. CrewAI tutorials -&gt; https://docs.crewai.com/introduction#ready-to-start-building%3F At the end of the page you'll find a guide on how to build a crew of agents that research and analyze a topic, and create a report. Also, there are useful guides on how to build a single CrewAI agent and a workflow 2. Building with CAMEL multi-agent framework -&gt; https://github.com/camel-ai/camel Offers guides, cookbooks and other useful information to build even million agent societies, explore and work with MAS 3.
