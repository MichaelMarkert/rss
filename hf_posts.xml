Accepted values: - auto (future default) - medium - large (current default) The auto mode checks total CUDA tensor size during startup: - More than 30GB → large - Otherwise → medium See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 09:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/cbensimon/356529804559377</guid></item><item><title>Samsung Hacking Incident: Samsung Electronics' Official Hugging Face Account Compromised</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</link><description>Samsung Hacking Incident: Samsung Electronics' Official Hugging Face Account Compromised Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account has been hacked. Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on "1 million W200 GPUs," hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack. Samsung Electronics appears to be unaware of this situation, as they have not taken any visible...</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 09:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</guid></item><item><title>🌟 Introducing Ilúvatar: Creative Design &amp; Invention AI 🌟</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/340514834154581</link><description>🌟 Introducing Ilúvatar: Creative Design &amp; Invention AI 🌟 Link: ginipick/IDEA-DESIGN Hello, AI creators! 👋 Today I'm introducing Ilúvatar, an amazing tool that automatically generates innovative design and invention ideas. ✨ Key Features 🧠 AI-Powered Idea Generation: Creates detailed design/invention ideas from simple prompts 🔍 Web Search Integration: Incorporates real-time information to reflect latest trends 📊 Kaggle Dataset Analysis: Provides data-driven insights 🖼️ Automatic Image Generation: Creates image prompts visualizing your ideas 📁 File Upload Support: Analyzes reference materials (text, CSV, PDF) 📈 Business Frameworks: Includes SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, BCG Matrix analyses 🌏 Multilingual Support: Available in both English and Korean 🎯 Perfect For 💼 Product Designers/Developers: When you need fresh product concepts 🔬 Researchers/Inventors: When you need innovative idea inspiration 📝 Planners/Marketers: When you need differentiated business strategies 🎓 Students/Educators:...</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 09:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/340514834154581</guid></item><item><title>We're thrilled to announce the launch of our comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) Course!

We just released a guide on creating human trajectory datasets with C/ua Okay, so you’ve gotten your environment up and also tested a few agent runs. You’ll likely have encountered cases where your agent was successful at doing some tasks but also places where it got stuck or outright failed. Now what? If you’ve ever wondered exactly what your computer agent is doing and why it sometimes doesn’t do what you expected, then the Trajectory Viewer for C/ua is here to help! Whether you’re a seasoned developer or someone who just wants to dive in and see results, this tool makes it easy to explore every step your agent takes on your screen. Plus, if you want to start thinking about generating data to train your own agentic model (we’ll cover training in an upcoming blog, so look forward to it), then our Trajectory Viewer might be for you.

Our work focused on 1) curating and evaluating culturally relevant African vision dataset then 2) Fine-tuning the Aya vision model to support underrepresented languages in Africa. I represented my beloved Sierra Leone with the Krio language. Krio is a beautiful first language spoken by a majority of our population. It was a humbling and inspiring experience to have it recognized, thanks to the relentless effort of everyone on the team. Special thanks to BK for offering me this opportunity 🫡 and to Cohere AI for such an amazing global research expedition🙏 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 09:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/582641914930631</guid></item></channel></rss>
