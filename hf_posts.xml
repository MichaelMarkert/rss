For comparison: when R1 launched, I tracked 550 derivatives (across 8 base models) in a week, with ~3M downloads. GPT-OSS is ahead on adoption and engagement. It‚Äôs also the most-liked release of any major LLM this summer. The 20B and 120B versions quickly shot past Kimi K2, GLM 4.5, and others in likes. Most-downloaded GPT-OSS models include LM Studio and Unsloth AI versions: 1Ô∏è‚É£ openai/gpt-oss-20b - 2.0M 2Ô∏è‚É£ lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-MLX-8bit - 750K 3Ô∏è‚É£ openai/gpt-oss-120b - 430K 4Ô∏è‚É£ unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF - 380K 5Ô∏è‚É£ lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF - 330K The 20B version is clearly finding its audience, showing the power of smaller, faster, more memory- and energy-efficient models.

What's new: I've expanded the Personal Finance Reasoning Dataset, which now includes 18.9k samples of real-world financial questions paired with detailed, empathetic answers. The previous generation pipeline was also streamlined with better psychological context and response validations. I've also released new Kuvera models trained on this improved dataset: - Kuvera-4B &amp; 8B: These are my upgraded non-reasoning models, fine-tuned to provide practical financial advice. I've specifically trained the 8B model to better understand the user's emotional context. - Kuvera-12B: A first experimental reasoning model focused on the query resolution. As the sole person working on this project, this release is a noticeable step forward from my previous work, offering more powerful and nuanced tools for financial AI.
