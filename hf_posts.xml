What makes it special? At Hawky.ai we are started experimenting with Qwen3 recently for Analysis and Optimization. Unlike traditional tools that look at text, images, or audio separately, Qwen3-Omni analyzes everything together. It handles 119 languages, processes 40-minute audio sequences, and understands both images and videos—all at once. The cool part? It's 2-3x faster than similar models thanks to its MoE architecture. Real applications I'm seeing: Ad Analysis: It scores video ads by combining visual elements, audio tone, and text—giving 25% better CTR predictions than single-mode tools. Campaign Localization: Drop in one ad, get 10 localized versions with native voiceovers in under a minute. Perfect for testing across markets. Market Research: Feed it competitor content, podcasts, or UGC videos. It extracts actionable...</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 13:29:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Sri-Vigneshwar-DJ/891594547382960</guid></item><item><title>Introducing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/721687692996128</link><description>Introducing SelmaNajih001/StockPredictionExplanation , built with GRPO and RAG: -GRPO trains the model to predict and explain stock direction. -RAG grounds explanations in historical financial news and central bank speeches.

Probably, you have done it with minimising a KL divergence, and it somehow worked. Well, not that well, right? 1️⃣ Your model tends to memorise! 2️⃣ Your model might get the right answer, but its reasoning might be flawed. To fix those problems, we rethink distillation and process a new approach! A method that is based on constrained RL that comes with nice theoretical guarantees and excellent performance!

This tension is especially visible in conversational systems, where safeguards can sometimes feel more paternalistic than supportive. In my latest piece for Hugging Face, I argue that open source and community-driven approaches offer a promising (though not exclusive) way forward. ✨ Transparency can make safety mechanisms into learning opportunities. ✨ Collaboration with diverse communities makes safeguards more relevant across contexts. ✨ Iteration in the open lets protections evolve rather than freeze into rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Of course, this isn’t a silver bullet. Top-down safety measures will still be necessary in some cases. But if we only rely on corporate control, we risk building systems that are safe at the expense of trust and autonomy.
