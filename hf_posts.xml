So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI’s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf &lt;resource&gt; &lt;action&gt;. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember? The full rationale, implementation details, and migration notes are in the blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-cli See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:26:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Wauplin/921235032674409</guid></item><item><title>Is it possible to apply for a resources grant for a whole organization, or do you need to apply for each repo individually?

I think it'd be pretty cool to have something like the discord-community org for None-yet in terms of resource allocation (multiple spaces running on cpu upgrade . I realize the scale of the community is just a tiny bit different, and that having this for a public org (one where anyone can join) isn't super fiscally responsible, but we'll be good. I promise we will! Right, guys?

Right now, we're in the final stages of testing, and we're about to drop a game-changing milestone in the open-source AI community. 🎉 In just two weeks, we've managed to almost 4x the size of the largest open-source LLM at that time (and we are still 2.6x bigger than the largest LLM). This is unprecedented and a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of pushing AI to its limits. The future of open-source AI is now. Stay tuned for the release – we’re just getting started. - Model testing finishes: 24hrs from now - Model gets uploaded: 30hrs from now - Related code/inference stack gets published: 70-90hrs from now See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:26:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Blazgo/275361717193984</guid></item><item><title>NEW ARTICLE: "Detecting Beyond Sight: Building AI-Enabled SAR Intelligence with Synthetic Data"</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/822376760397275</link><description>NEW ARTICLE: "Detecting Beyond Sight: Building AI-Enabled SAR Intelligence with Synthetic Data" Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) reveals what optical sensors can’t. AI can turn that information into actionable intelligence—but only with the right training data. In our latest blog, we explore how Falcon’s new virtual SAR sensor solves the SAR data bottleneck for AI development. As the newest addition to Falcon’s sensor library, it models radar returns with precision—including azimuth, range resolution, signal intensity, and noise. This Falcon-specific, GPU-accelerated raytraced SAR model is exposed via Falcon’s Python API, giving teams precise, control over radar wave propagation and enabling physically grounded, highly customizable, and user-friendly SAR simulation. The result? High-fidelity, automatically labeled synthetic SAR imagery from any scenario—on demand. No custom setup. No external workflows. Just mission-ready data for building AI models across defense, disaster response,...</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:26:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/822376760397275</guid></item><item><title>Big respect to the Qwen team!

TTD-DR applies diffusion-inspired techniques to iteratively refine research reports while grounding them in real web sources. How it works: • Generates initial draft • Identifies knowledge gaps • Searches web for missing info • Iteratively refines through "denoising" steps • Produces comprehensive reports with 15-30+ sources The magic? It works with ANY model so you can choose your favorite open-source models on HF! Key results: - 47 complex research queries tested - Every report backed by real web sources - Quality rivals human research analysts - No more hallucinations on current events! Try it: pip install optillm Then use "deep_research-your-model-name" as the model identifier - Implementation: https://github.com/codelion/optillm/tree/main/optillm/plugins/deep_research - Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075v1 - Sample...</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:26:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/260744865592486</guid></item></channel></rss>
