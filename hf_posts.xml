Kokoro TTS (v1.0) can now run 100% locally in your browser w/ WebGPU acceleration. Real-time text-to-speech without a server. ⚡️ Generate 10 seconds of speech in ~1 second for $0. What will you build? 🔥 webml-community/kokoro-webgpu The most difficult part was getting the model running in the first place, but the next steps are simple: ✂️ Implement sentence splitting, allowing for streamed responses 🌍 Multilingual support (only phonemization left) Who wants to help?

I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</link><description>Wanted: Peak Data. I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model: + AVM data: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode audio &amp; text from source + Professional audio: Permissive (CC0, Apache, MIT, CC-BY) This audio should *impress* most native speakers, not just barely pass their audio Turing tests. Professional-caliber means S or A-tier, not your average bloke off the street. Traditional TTS may not make the cut. Absolutely no low-fi microphone recordings like Common Voice. The bar is much higher than last time, so there are no timelines yet and I expect it may take longer to collect such mythical data. Raising the bar means evicting quite a bit of old data, and voice/language availability may decrease. The theme is *quality* over quantity. I would rather have 1 hour of A/S-tier than 100 hours of mid data. I have nothing to offer but the north star of a future Apache 2.0 TTS model, so prefer data that you *already have* and costs you *nothing extra* to send. Additionally, *all* the new...</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 05:07:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</guid></item><item><title>I wrote an article about G2P:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/562263062112849</link><description>I wrote an article about G2P: https://hf.co/blog/hexgrad/g2p G2P is an underrated piece of small TTS models, like offensive linemen who do a bunch of work and get no credit. Instead of relying on explicit G2P, larger speech models implicitly learn this task by eating many thousands of hours of audio data. They often use a 500M+ parameter LLM at the front to predict latent audio tokens over a learned codebook, then decode these tokens into audio. Kokoro instead relies on G2P preprocessing, is 82M parameters, and thus needs less audio to learn. Because of this, we can cherrypick high fidelity audio for training data, and deliver solid speech for those voices. In turn, this excellent audio quality &amp; lack of background noise helps explain why Kokoro is very competitive in single-voice TTS Arenas.

Because it facilitates teaching and learning! Over the past few months I've engaged with (no joke) thousands of students based on SmolLM. - People have inferred, fine-tuned, aligned, and evaluated this smol model. - People used they're own machines and they've used free tools like colab, kaggle, and spaces. - People tackled use cases in their job, for fun, in their own language, and with their friends. upvote the paper SmolLM2: When Smol Goes Big -- Data-Centric Training of a Small Language Model (2502.02737) See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 05:07:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/638294801973727</guid></item><item><title>Introducing 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽-𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 by Hugging Face! 💥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/410805194640777</link><description>Introducing 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽-𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 by Hugging Face! 💥 OpenAI's latest agentic app Deep Research seems really good... But it's closed, as usual. ⏱️ So with a team of cracked colleagues, we set ourselves a 24hours deadline to replicate and open-source Deep Research! ⏱️ ➡️ We built open-Deep-Research, an entirely open agent that can: navigate the web autonomously, scroll and search through pages, download and manipulate files, run calculation on data... We aimed for the best performance: are the agent's answers really rigorous? On GAIA benchmark, Deep Research had 67% accuracy on the validation set. ➡️ open Deep Research is at 55% (powered by o1), it is: - the best pass@1 solution submitted - the best open solution 💪💪 And it's only getting started ! Please jump in, drop PRs, and let's bring it to the top !

DOT is much smaller (sometimes 100 times less parameters) than previous SOTA models, trains faster, and avoids complexity: 🚫 No generative models (Diffusion, VAE, GANs) 🚫 No discretization/tokenization of actions 🚫 No reinforcement learning or multi-stage training ✅ Just learns from human demos, plain and simple This is still early — more complex real-life tasks need testing, and no guarantees it will actually work well there, but I think it's interesting to share. Sometimes, simpler approaches can be just as effective (or even better) than complex ones. 🔗 Open-source code and detailed description:...</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 05:07:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IliaLarchenko/621814832633058</guid></item></channel></rss>
