Our v2.0 quants set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU and KL Divergence, meaning you can now run &amp; fine-tune quantized LLMs while preserving as much accuracy as possible. Llama 4: unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct-GGUF DeepSeek-R1: unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-UD Gemma 3: unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF We made selective layer quantization much smarter. Instead of modifying only a subset of layers, we now dynamically quantize all layers so every layer has a different bit. Now, our dynamic method can be applied to all LLM architectures, not just MoE's. Blog with Details: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/dynamic-v2.0 All our future GGUF uploads will leverage Dynamic 2.0 and our hand curated 300K–1.5M token calibration dataset to improve conversational chat performance. For accurate benchmarking, we built an evaluation framework to match the reported 5-shot MMLU scores of Llama 4 and Gemma 3. This allowed apples-to-apples comparisons between full-...</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:26:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/766411311755038</guid></item><item><title>BOOOOM: Today I'm dropping TINY AGENTS</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176</link><description>BOOOOM: Today I'm dropping TINY AGENTS the 50 lines of code Agent in Javascript 🔥 I spent the last few weeks working on this, so I hope you will like it. I've been diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol) to understand what the hype was all about. It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that can be hooked to LLMs. But while doing that, came my second realization: Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. 🤯 ➡️ read it exclusively on the official HF blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:26:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176</guid></item><item><title>FlowReasoner is a new system that builds a custom set of small AI agents for every user question.

Unlike search based methods it uses reasoning driven optimization with external execution feedback. ✅ First, it distills reasoning data using DeepSeek R1-671B to build multi agent systems. 🤖 ✅ Then, reasoning data used for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B via supervised fine tuning for basic reasoning skills. 💡 ✅ Finally, RL with GRPO (optimizes by comparing response groups from queries/tasks) to improve reasoning.

It's pretty simple! 📁 The input files are converted into PDF by PdfItDown ( https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown ) 📑 The PDF text is extracted using LlamaIndex readers 🦛 The text is chunked exploiting Chonkie 🧮 The chunks are embedded thanks to Sentence Transformers models 🗄️ The embeddings are loaded into a Qdrant vector database And you're done!✅ Curious of trying it? Install it by running: 𝘱𝘪𝘱 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘴𝘵-𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 And you can start using it in your python scripts!🐍 Don't forget to star it on GitHub and let me know...</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:26:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/as-cle-bert/792997014536541</guid></item><item><title>ComfyUI 1-click Installers updated for latest official Torch 2.7 with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5000 series support + older GPUs) - Automatically installs xFormers, Flash Attention, Sage Attention, Triton, DeepSpeed, insightface, accelerate, onnxruntime-gpu for Windows</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/127802170120239</link><description>ComfyUI 1-click Installers updated for latest official Torch 2.7 with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5000 series support + older GPUs) - Automatically installs xFormers, Flash Attention, Sage Attention, Triton, DeepSpeed, insightface, accelerate, onnxruntime-gpu for Windows 1-click Installers zip file is here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/105023709 xFormers compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) and Linux (Python 3.10 only) Flash Attention compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) and Linux (Python 3.10 only) Sage Attention compiled by me for Linux (Python 3.10 only) insightface compiled by me for Windows (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) Pre-compiled Triton + Sage Attention + DeepSpeed installed for Windows You must have pre-installed Python on your system manually Tutorial for Python + CUDA 12.8 installation : https://youtu.be/DrhUHnYfwC0 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:26:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/127802170120239</guid></item><item><title>We have just released a new version of⭐https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-agent ⭐exposing an API to be used in</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/daavoo/842395370416966</link><description>We have just released a new version of⭐https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-agent ⭐exposing an API to be used in async contexts: import asyncio from any_agent import AgentConfig, AnyAgent, TracingConfig from any_agent.tools import search_web async def main (): agent = await AnyAgent.create_async( "openai" , AgentConfig( model_id= "gpt-4.1-mini" , instructions= "You are the main agent.

The panelists are managers/directors of Fortune 500 companies. These people make things happen and own results, so their stories and pain points are fresh. (1) Models are used EVERYWHERE, customer facing and internal support, etc. (2) A successful application must improve one of the following: revenue (💵💵), cost (💵💵), CSAT (still 💵💵) (3) They proactively search on 🤗HF🤗 for models and use them. Open source models (especially small ones) can flexibly fit into their existing workflows/infras, which enable them to deliver, and fast. (4) The main barrier for adoption is license. A director told me they picked a model and finetuned it, then learned they would have to share enhancements. As a result, they dropped this model and the million dollar impact went to another model. So to fellow model builders: (1) celebrate that our work is useful and generate lots of values (2) make your license permissive if you want maximum impact See...</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:26:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/992154552707771</guid></item></channel></rss>
