It perfectly implements the common AGI prerequisites emphasized by Yann LeCun (Meta), OpenAI, and Google DeepMind within a single LLM. 📋 AGI Level 1 Core Requirements = SOMA's Perfect Implementation ✅ 🎯 Planning Capability → Supervisor AI autonomously designs and executes comprehensive analysis roadmaps 🧩 Role Differentiation &amp; Modularity → A single LLM instantly differentiates into 5 expert AIs for collaboration 🔄 Self-reflection &amp; Feedback Loops → Evaluator AI continuously validates and directs improvements 🛠️ Tool-use &amp; Autonomy → Full automation from web search to report generation 🎮 Long-term Agency Structure → Completes complex 11-stage collaborative processes end-to-end 🔷 SOMA's Three Core Structures 🧭 Self-...</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:26:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/674788441765421</guid></item><item><title>Layer-wise and Pruned versions of Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/678649623001881</link><description>Layer-wise and Pruned versions of Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B * Tesor-wise: eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF * Pruned: eaddario/Qwen3-30B-A3B-pruned-GGUF Even though the Perplexity scores of the pruned version are 3 times higher, the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, Truthful QA and WinoGrande scores are holding remarkably well, considering two layers were removed (5 and 39). This seems to support Xin Men et al conclusions in ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You Expect (2403.03853) Results summary in the model's card and test results in the ./scores directory.

With modular architecture, advanced tool use and real web access, they go far beyond typical AI. While big-name agents get the spotlight, we want to highlight some powerful recent open-source alternatives: 1. DeerFlow -&gt; https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow A modular multi-agent system combining LMs and tools for automated research and code analysis. It links a coordinator, planner, team of specialized agent, and reporter, and converts reports to speech via Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2. Alita -&gt; https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita Uses a single problem-solving module for scalable reasoning through simplicity. It self-evolves by generating and reusing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) from open-source tools to build external capabilities for diverse tasks 3.

Key results: - 21.8% average decode speed improvement on Apple Silicon - 36.7% improvement on long-context transformer attention - Discovered novel vectorization patterns and 2-pass softmax algorithm The system evolved a Metal kernel for Qwen3's Grouped Query Attention from a basic 3-pass implementation into something with sophisticated Apple Silicon optimizations that would take experts months to discover manually. The evolved kernel automatically found the optimal vec&lt;T,8&gt; operations for 128-dim attention heads and fused softmax computation with value accumulation. Really excited about the potential here - imagine evolutionary algorithms automatically discovering optimizations across all our AI...</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:26:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/512779846806813</guid></item></channel></rss>
