This week Hugging Face learn has a whole pathway on finetuning for agentic applications. You can follow these two courses to get knowledge on levelling up your agent game beyond prompts: 1️⃣ New Supervised Fine-tuning unit in the NLP Course https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter11/1 2️⃣New Finetuning for agents bonus module in the Agents Course https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/bonus-unit1/introduction Fine-tuning will squeeze everything out of your model for how you’re using it, more than any prompt.

It seems not. Researchers from Shanghai Jiaotong University just demonstrated that carefully selected examples can boost math performance in large language models using SFT —no huge datasets or RL procedures needed. Their procedure allows Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to jump from 6.5% to 57% on AIME and from 59% to 95% on MATH, while using only 1% of the data in previous approaches. ⚡ The Less-is-More Reasoning Hypothesis: ‣ Minimal but precise examples that showcase optimal reasoning patterns matter more than sheer quantity ‣ Pre-training knowledge plus sufficient computational resources at inference levels up math skills ➡️ Core techniques: ‣ High-quality reasoning chains with self-verification steps ‣ 817 handpicked problems that encourage deeper reasoning ‣ Enough inference-time computation to allow...</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/436586297766836</guid></item><item><title>🔥 Meet Muse: that can generate a game environment based on visuals or players’ controller actions. It was developed by Microsoft Research in collaboration with Ninja Theory (Hellblade developer). It’s built on something called the World and Human Action Model (WHAM-1.6B model). They trained on 7 years of Bleeding Edge gameplay and it can generate 2 minute long 3D game sequences with consistent physics and character behaviors all from just a second of input. They’ve gone and open-sourced it too. Open weights, the WHAM Demonstrator, and sample data on Azure AI Foundry for anyone to play with.

Our 49-page report details Sailor2's development journey, including multilingual data cleaning, small model data mixture simulations, multi-stage continual pre-training, multi-stage post-training, and multi-cultural multi-lingual evaluations. Sailor2 aims to streamline the multilingual model pre-training process efficiently for the community. 🧭 We highlight Sailor2's impressive performance in low-resource language translation scenarios and its cultural understanding advantages in Southeast Asia, promoting practical applications for regional languages. Model updates include: 💡 More precise outputs: Reduced redundancy in model outputs through refined post-training data and optimization techniques. 🌈 Handling longer texts: Expanded to handle up to 128K context length in Southeast Asian languages through long-text training. ⚡️ Faster inference: Achieved 2.5x faster inference...</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/dreamerdeo/426313569382827</guid></item><item><title>The latest paper of DeepSeek is now available on the Daily Papers page 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/586092411565297</link><description>The latest paper of DeepSeek is now available on the Daily Papers page 🚀 You can reach out to the authors directly on this page👇 Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse Attention (2502.11089) See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/586092411565297</guid></item></channel></rss>
