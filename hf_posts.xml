For all inputs: 1 . Start with &lt;thinking&gt; - Break down problems step - by - step - Consider multiple approaches - Calculate carefully - Identify errors - Evaluate critically - Explore edge cases - Check knowledge accuracy - Cite sources when possible 2 . End with &lt;/thinking&gt; 3 . Then respond clearly based on your thinking. The &lt;thinking&gt; section is invisible to users and helps you produce better answers. For math: show all work and verify For coding: reason through logic and test edge cases For facts: verify information and consider reliability For creative tasks: explore options before deciding For analysis: examine multiple interpretations Example: &lt;thinking&gt; [ Step - by - step analysis] [Multiple perspectives] [Self-critique] [Final conclusion] &lt;/thinking&gt; [Clear, concise response to user] See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/luigi12345/612317420621834</guid></item><item><title>🔥 It's out!

We dive deep into the algorithm behind DeepSeek R1 with an advanced and hands-on guide to interpreting GRPO. 🔗 https://huggingface.co/reasoning-course This unit is super useful if you’re tuning models with reinforcement learning. It will help with: - interpreting loss and reward progression during training runs - selecting effective parameters for training - reviewing and defining effective reward functions This unit also works up smoothly toward the existing practical exercises form @ mlabonne and Unsloth. 📣 Shout out to @ ShirinYamani who wrote the unit.

Why did you remove the "Regen" feature from the ZeroGPU feature? Is this an error or intended? I am now limited to 13 images per 24 hrs. Using my space. When I upgraded to Pro, it was exclusively for the 5x more usage and the faster regen. The reason I spend my hard earned money on your site was for this feature. This is totally unacceptable. ######## Other Pro Users please reply and tag others IF YOU AGREE or DISAGREE. ######## @ Always-cheating ,@anonymous111110987654321 ,@Arshili @ bedspirit @ blackedguy @ John6666 ,@DavidBaloches @ E-07 ,@f-14 @ mindfulpeoples @ multimodalart See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Keltezaa/754755723533287</guid></item><item><title>ritvik77/ContributionChartHuggingFace</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ritvik77/315133968126281</link><description>ritvik77/ContributionChartHuggingFace It's Ready! One feature Hugging Face could really benefit from is a contribution heatmap — a visual dashboard to track user engagement and contributions across models, datasets, and models over the year, similar to GitHub’s contribution graph. Guess what, Clem Delangue mentioned idea about using HF API reference for it and we made it for use. If you are a Hugging Face user add this Space in your collection and it will give you all stats about your contributions and commits nearly same as GitHub. It's still a prototype and still working on it as a product feature.
