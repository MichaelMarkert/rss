We released the first version of just that: Crowd-Eval Add one line of code to your training loop and you will have a new real human loss curve in your W&amp;B dashboard. Thousands of real humans from around the world rating your model in real time at the cost of a few dollars per checkpoint is a game changer. Check it out here: https://github.com/RapidataAI/crowd-eval First 5 people to put it in their loop get 100'000 human responses for free!

Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

"Integrity Threats in AI: When Data Poisoning Undermines Model Effectiveness" from Duality AI is now on HuggingFace here: https://huggingface.co/blog/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/integrity-threats-in-ai Significant threats to AI model performance aren‚Äôt always loud or obvious. Integrity violations‚Äîlike subtle data poisoning attacks‚Äîcan quietly erode your model‚Äôs reliability, long before anyone notices. These attacks can be surprisingly effective with minimal changes to the dataset. At Duality, our work in high-stakes sectors like defense has driven us to tackle this threat head-on. In our latest blog from Duality's Director of Infrastructure and Security at Duality, David Strout, we unpack how data poisoning works, why it‚Äôs so dangerous, and how organizations can secure their AI pipelines with clear provenance, regular performance auditing, and a trusted synthetic data supply chain.
