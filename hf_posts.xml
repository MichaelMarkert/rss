I have done over 64 different unique Wan 2.2 trainings to prepare the very best working training configurations for you. The configurations are fully working locally with as low as 6 GB GPUs. So you will be able to train your awesome Wan 2.2 image or video generation LoRAs on your Windows computer with easiness. Moreover, I have shown how to train on cloud platforms RunPod and Massed Compute so even if you have no GPU or you want faster training, you can train on cloud for very cheap prices fully privately.

Instead of only matching surface-level preferences, the system now implements a multi-dimensional semantic reasoning architecture that emphasizes real-life compatibility and risk awareness. Key technical improvements: - SBERT-powered semantic understanding with dynamic weight allocation across six constraint dimensions (space, activity, noise, grooming, experience, family) - Hierarchical constraint management distinguishing critical safety constraints from flexible preferences, with progressive relaxation when needed -Multi-head scoring system combining semantic matching (15%), lifestyle compatibility (70%), constraint adherence (10%), and confidence calibration (5%) -Intelligent risk filtering that applies graduated penalties (-10% to...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/213826857024975</guid></item><item><title>我即将达到公共存储空间上限。我发现我的仓库 John1604/Kimi-K2-Thinking-q6K-gguf 没有获得足够的下载量，几乎占用了 1T 存储空间。尽管我喜爱 Kimi K2 的思考方式，但可能不得不删除这个模型。因为它是一个真正的开源 1T LLM，与任何前沿的 LLM 模型相媲美。在 AI 竞争中，美国有四家公司拥有1T+模型：xAI,  OpenAI, 谷歌和Anthropologie。中国也有四家公司拥有1T+模型：阿里巴巴, Kimi, DeepSeek和GLM。目前双方势均力敌。</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/712509372180068</link><description>我即将达到公共存储空间上限。我发现我的仓库 John1604/Kimi-K2-Thinking-q6K-gguf 没有获得足够的下载量，几乎占用了 1T 存储空间。尽管我喜爱 Kimi K2 的思考方式，但可能不得不删除这个模型。因为它是一个真正的开源 1T LLM，与任何前沿的 LLM 模型相媲美。在 AI 竞争中，美国有四家公司拥有1T+模型：xAI, OpenAI, 谷歌和Anthropologie。中国也有四家公司拥有1T+模型：阿里巴巴, Kimi, DeepSeek和GLM。目前双方势均力敌。 I'm about to reach my public storage limit. I've discovered that my repository John1604/Kimi-K2-Thinking-q6K-gguf isn't getting enough downloads and is nearly consuming 1TB of storage. While I love Kimi K2's way of thinking, I have to delete this model because it's a true open-source 1TB LLM, comparable to any cutting-edge LLM model. In the AI ​​race, four US companies have 1TB+ models: xAI, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. China also has four companies with 1TB+ models: Alibaba, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GLM. Currently, the two sides are evenly matched. Only American team and Chinese team have LLM with 1T+ parameters. Let's cheer for them to reach AGI in next 5 to 10 years. Maybe a 64T chinese model will do it -- Human and cat brain...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/712509372180068</guid></item><item><title>From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering: Main Design Patterns</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/746586334382009</link><description>From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering: Main Design Patterns Earlier on, we relied on clever prompt wording, but now structured, complete context matters more than just magic phrasing. The next year is going to be a year of context engineering which expands beyond prompt engineering. The two complement each other: prompt engineering shapes how we ask, while context engineering shapes what the model knows, sees, and can do. To keep things clear, here are the main techniques and design patterns in both areas, with some useful resources for further exploration: ▪️ 9 Prompt Engineering Techniques (configuring input text) 1. Zero-shot prompting – giving a single instruction without examples. Relies entirely on pretrained knowledge. 2. Few-shot prompting – adding input–output examples to encourage model to show the desired behavior. ⟶ https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 3. Role prompting – assigning a persona or role (e.g. "You are a senior researcher," "Say it as a specialist in...</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:29:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/746586334382009</guid></item><item><title>Hey everyone!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/283996096084237</link><description>Hey everyone!

That friction slows teams down especially when people use different setups. At Voiden, we believe your API artifacts should work anywhere your team does. Our files open seamlessly in VS Code, GitHub, custom Electron clients, and more, without being locked into a specific workspace or tool. Key benefits: -Portability across editors, repos, platforms, and team setups -No proprietary workspace: the repo is the workspace -Easy integration with CI pipelines, linters, and future tools -Future-proof your API workflows with open and flexible artifacts Voiden empowers devs and teams collaborate and stay agile as tools and platforms evolve.
