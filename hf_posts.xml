To stay up to date with what’s happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert -&gt; https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. "A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -&gt; https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It’s packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3. "Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning" video course by Shiyu Zhao -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhdbSEZZbDaFWPX4gehhwB9vJZJ1DNm8 Offers a mathematical...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 05:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/484268922176188</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Building Better Evaluations: 32K Image Annotations Now Available</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/653065305581211</link><description>🚀 Building Better Evaluations: 32K Image Annotations Now Available Today, we're releasing an expanded version: 32K images annotated with 3.7M responses from over 300K individuals which was completed in under two weeks using the Rapidata Python API. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback-32k A few months ago, we published one of our most liked dataset with 13K images based on the @ data-is-better-together 's dataset, following Google's research on "Rich Human Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10240 ). It collected over 1.5M responses from 150K+ participants. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback In the examples below, users highlighted words from prompts that were not correctly depicted in the generated images. Higher word scores indicate more frequent issues. If an image captured the prompt accurately, users could select [No_mistakes]. We're continuing to work on large-scale human feedback and model evaluation.

(Qwen2.5 was pre-trained on 18 trillion tokens.) ✅Qwen3 dense models match the performance of larger Qwen2.5 models. For example, Qwen3-1.7B/4B/8B/14B/32B perform like Qwen2.5-3B/7B/14B/32B/72B. ✅ Three stage done while pretraining: • Stage 1: General language learning and knowledge building. • Stage 2: Reasoning boost with STEM, coding, and logic skills. • Stage 3: Long context training ✅ It supports MCP in the model ✅ Strong agent skills ✅ Supports seamless between thinking mode (for hard tasks like math and coding) and non-thinking mode (for fast chatting) inside...</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 05:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/337137510653930</guid></item><item><title>Kimi-Audio 🚀🎧 an OPEN audio foundation model released by Moonshot AI</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/658134534684379</link><description>Kimi-Audio 🚀🎧 an OPEN audio foundation model released by Moonshot AI moonshotai/Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct ✨ 7B ✨ 13M+ hours of pretraining data ✨ Novel hybrid input architecture ✨ Universal audio capabilities (ASR, AQA, AAC, SER, SEC/ASC, end-to-end conversation) See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 05:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/658134534684379</guid></item><item><title>Post of the Day</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ProCreations/966463038154493</link><description>Post of the Day I’m fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-0.5B to be extremely good at math, using high-quality datasets and some smart training strategies. The logs are looking really promising so far! Expected release: Tomorrow morning? I’ll post as soon as it’s ready — stay tuned. If you want faster updates or just wanna chat about it, come join my Discord: https://discord.gg/EXsug2Ux29 (Heads up: we might ask a couple quick questions when you join — just making sure we keep the server safe.) Also, check out one of the datasets we’re using: ProCreations/SimpleMath This project is also helping shape the future of IntellIte. The insights and techniques we’re developing here — better dataset curation, fine-tuning tricks, and evaluation methods — will directly contribute to making IntellIte even sharper, faster, and more reliable, especially for math and reasoning tasks. Big progress ahead. Can’t wait to share it with you all!

Add pydantic==2.10.6 to requirements.txt or upgrade Gradio to the latest version. 2. Upgrade PyTorch to 2.2.0 or later ( torch&gt;=2.2.0 for Zero GPU space). 3. Fix Transformers to 4.49.0 or earlier ( transformers&lt;=4.49.0 for spaces using Transformers or Diffusers). 4. Fix huggingface_hub to the old version ( huggingface_hub==0.25.2 for if an error like cached_download is not available occurs or inference does not work properly) 5. Specifying WORKDIR in Dockerfile may cause the application to fail to start with error 137.
