A month ago there were 5,500 users/orgs on Xet with 150K repos and 4PB. Today? ü§ó 700,000 users/orgs üìà 350,000 repos üöÄ 15PB Meanwhile, our migrations have pushed throughput to numbers that are bonkers. In June, we hit upload speeds of 577Gb/s (crossing 500Gb/s for the first time). These are hard numbers to put into context, but let's try: The latest run of the Common Crawl from commoncrawl was 471 TB. We now have ~32 crawls stored in Xet. At peak upload speed we could move the latest crawl into Xet in about two hours. We're moving to a new phase in the process, so stay tuned. This shift in gears means it's also time to roll up our sleeves and look at all the bytes we have and the value we're adding to the community. I already have some homework from @ RichardErkhov to look at the dedupe across their uploads, and I'll be doing...</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 09:25:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/866221600890917</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</link><description>Introducing Dhanishtha 2.0: World's first Intermediate Thinking Model Dhanishtha 2.0 is the world's first LLM designed to think between the responses. Unlike other Reasoning LLMs, which think just once. Dhanishtha can think, rethink, self-evaluate, and refine in between responses using multiple &lt;think&gt; blocks. This technique makes it Hinghlt Token efficient it Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 --- You can try our model from: https://helpingai.co/chat Also, we're gonna Open-Source Dhanistha on July 1st. --- For Devs: üîë Get your API key at https://helpingai.co/dashboard from HelpingAI import HAI # pip install HelpingAI ==1.1.1 from rich import print hai = HAI( api_key = "hl-***********************" ) response = hai.chat.completions.create( model = "Dhanishtha-2.0-preview" , messages=[{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "What is the value of ‚à´0‚àûùë•3/ùë•‚àí1ùëëùë• ?" }], stream = True , hide_think = False # Hide or show models thinking ) for chunk in response: print...</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 09:25:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</guid></item><item><title>Hi everyone,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</link><description>Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been running small language models (SLLMs) directly on smartphones ‚Äî completely offline, with no cloud backend or server API calls. I wanted to share: 1. ‚ö° Tokens/sec performance across several SLLMs 2. ü§ñ Observations on hardware utilization (where the workload actually runs) 3. üìè Trade-offs between model size, latency, and feasibility for mobile apps There are reports for below models - QWEN3 0.6B - NVIDIA/Nemotron QWEN 1.5B - SimpleScaling S1 - TinyLlama - Unsloth tuned Llama 3.2 1B - Naver HyperClova 0.5B üìúComparable Benchmark reports (no cloud, all on-device): I‚Äôd really value your thoughts on: - Creative ideas to further optimize inference under these hardware constraints - Other compact LLMs worth testing on-device - Experiences you‚Äôve had trying to deploy LLMs at the edge If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôm happy to share more details on the test setup, hardware specs, or the tooling we used for these comparisons.

Hugging Face just wrapped 4 months of deep work with AMD to push kernel-level optimization on their MI300X GPUs. Now, it's time to share everything we learned. Join us in Paris at STATION F for a hands-on weekend of workshops and a hackathon focused on making open-source LLMs faster and more efficient on AMD.

This model runs entirely on a mobile device, without cloud, and without any manual optimization. It was built using ZETIC.MLange, and the best part? ‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs totally automated, free to use, and anyone can do it. You don‚Äôt need to write deployment code, tweak backends, or touch device-specific SDKs. Just upload your model ‚Äî and ZETIC.MLange handles the rest. üß† About the Model - Model: Polaris-4B-Preview - Size: ~4B parameters - Ranking: Top 3 on Hugging Face LLM Leaderboard (&lt;6B) - Tokenizer: Token-incremental inference supported - Modifications: None ‚Äî stock weights, just optimized for mobile ‚öôÔ∏è What ZETIC.MLange Does ZETIC.MLange is a fully automated deployment framework for On-Device AI, built for AI engineers who want to focus on models ‚Äî...</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 09:25:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/894951796717498</guid></item><item><title>üî•BEST DEBUG PROMPT FOR CLAUDE_CODE</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/samihalawa/553684674682033</link><description>üî•BEST DEBUG PROMPT FOR CLAUDE_CODE üò≤FIXES ANY REPO How can I prompt you so there will not be any More bug or thing?
