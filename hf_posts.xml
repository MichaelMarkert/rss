With the rapid advancement of AI agent technology, two architectures have come into the spotlight: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and MCO (Model Context Open-json). Today, we‚Äôll introduce the key features and differences of these two approaches. VIDraft/Agentic-AI-CHAT MCP: The Traditional Approach üèõÔ∏è Centralized Function Registry: All functions are hardcoded into the core system. Static Function Definitions &amp; Tight Coupling: New features require changes to the core application code, limiting scalability. Monolithic Design: Complex deployment and version management can cause a single error to affect the whole system. Code Example: '''py FUNCTION_REGISTRY = { "existing_function": existing_function, "new_function": new_function # Adding a new function } ''' MCO: A Revolutionary Approach üÜï JSON-based Function Definitions: Function details are stored in external JSON files, enabling dynamic module loading. Loose Coupling &amp;...</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/305569626054328</guid></item><item><title>Access requests enabled for latest GLM models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/160920719239523</link><description>Access requests enabled for latest GLM models While a fix is being implemented ( https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12957 ) I want to leave the models up for visibility and continued discussion, but want to prevent accidental downloads of known broken models (even though there are settings that could fix it at runtime for now) With this goal, I've enabled access requests. I don't really want your data, so I'm sorry that I don't think there's a way around that? But that's what I'm gonna do for now, and I'll remove the gate when a fix is up and verified and I have a chance to re-convert and quantize! Hope you don't mind in the mean time :D See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/160920719239523</guid></item><item><title>If you've followed the progress of robotics in the past 18 months, you've likely noticed how robotics is increasingly becoming the next frontier that AI will unlock.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/thomwolf/895902166332251</link><description>If you've followed the progress of robotics in the past 18 months, you've likely noticed how robotics is increasingly becoming the next frontier that AI will unlock. At Hugging Face‚Äîin robotics and across all AI fields‚Äîwe believe in a future where AI and robots are open-source, transparent, and affordable; community-built and safe; hackable and fun. We've had so much mutual understanding and passion working with the Pollen Robotics team over the past year that we decided to join forces! You can already find our open-source humanoid robot platform Reachy 2 on the Pollen website and the Pollen community and people here on the hub at pollen-robotics We're so excited to build and share more open-source robots with the world in the coming months!

And it's so cool, because each new paper adds a trick to the toolbox, making LLMs more capable without needing to scale parameter count of the models. So here are 13 new methods + 3 comprehensive studies on test-time scaling: 1. Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling (2504.02495) Probably, the most popular study. It proposes to boost inference-time scalability by improving reward modeling. To enhance performance, DeepSeek-GRM uses adaptive critiques, parallel sampling, pointwise generative RM, and Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) 2. T1: Tool-integrated Self-verification for Test-time Compute Scaling in Small Language Models (2504.04718) Allows small models to use external tools, like code interpreters and calculator, to enhance self-verification 3. Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code (2504.00810) Proposes to train LLMs on...</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/504548986821494</guid></item><item><title>üî• New reasoning models from the Chinese community, by Skywork Â§©Â∑•-ÊòÜ‰ªë‰∏áÁª¥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/225696597302421</link><description>üî• New reasoning models from the Chinese community, by Skywork Â§©Â∑•-ÊòÜ‰ªë‰∏áÁª¥ Skywork/skywork-or1-67fa1bcb41b436ef2def76b9 ‚ú®Skywork OR1-Math-7B &gt; Optimized for math reasoning ‚ú®Skywork-OR1-7B-preview &gt; Excels in math &amp; coding ‚ú®Skywork-OR1-32B-preview &gt; Matches Deepseek-R1 on math (AIME24/25) and coding (LiveCodeBench) Released under the Apache 2.0 license ü•≥ Final version coming in 2 weeks!
