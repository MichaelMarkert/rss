In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. 📤 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt; are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is &lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|user|&gt;. 📏 Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:21:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Japanese honorifics dataset: a dataset with 137 sentences covering the three main keigo forms: 尊敬語 (Sonkeigo), 謙譲語 (Kenjōgo), and 丁寧語 (Teineigo).

This fine tuned Gemma3 4B variant has a distinct, friendly, and exploratory persona - designed to help the user think and reflect. Atom is trained to ask questions, use approachable, yet relatable analogies in ELI5-style explanations, and engage in deep, reflective conversation. We plan to scale Atom's persona to larger architectures, and this iteration was created as part of that R&amp;D. Any and all feedback is always welcome as we continue to refine our approach.
