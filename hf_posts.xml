Uses computer vision to analyze frames every 10 seconds. Agents-MCP-Hackathon/wild-fire-tracker What it does: -Detects fire &amp; smoke in real-time -Works with webcam, video files, or RTSP streams -Shows confidence scores + color-coded alerts - Has both web UI and API integration Looking for feedback on: -Detection accuracy -What features would be most useful -Real-world use cases you'd want Would love to hear thoughts from anyone working in fire monitoring, emergency response, or just interested in computer vision projects! Try it out and let me know what you think.
