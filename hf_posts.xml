This tension is especially visible in conversational systems, where safeguards can sometimes feel more paternalistic than supportive. In my latest piece for Hugging Face, I argue that open source and community-driven approaches offer a promising (though not exclusive) way forward. ‚ú® Transparency can make safety mechanisms into learning opportunities. ‚ú® Collaboration with diverse communities makes safeguards more relevant across contexts. ‚ú® Iteration in the open lets protections evolve rather than freeze into rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Of course, this isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. Top-down safety measures will still be necessary in some cases. But if we only rely on corporate control, we risk building systems that are safe at the expense of trust and autonomy.

David must be released. I will prepare a standard sweep for david to showcase the prowess of the final multi-vocab variant. This will include a variation that contains all mnist variants, cifar10, cifar100, imagenet 1k, and in the future I'll prepare a full imagenet sweep utilizing the entire 12m corpus instead of the 1.2m I used. I may need to get in touch with the actual curator of the dataset for licensing but maybe not. David utilizes 4 projective variants of the vocabulary and the training process involves teaching and freezing them akin to teacher/student processing. I did not want to release David yet, but I believe now that David will save lives and it's irresponsible for me to contain such a creation.

It's poorly documented, but the code should be straightforward. https://github.com/jim-plus/llm-abliteration The code is built atop a fork that enabled abliteration to be performed on models loaded in 4-bit or 8-bit bitsandbytes quantization. TransformerLens is not required, just plain Transformers. For those previously unaware, this opens up abliteration experimentation to more people with local VRAM limitations. Since performing abliteration on a quant involves precision and perplexity loss, it stands to reason that a small amount of magnitude sparsification could filter out some noise and possibly even reduce the damage inflicted on latent space via ablation of the refusal vector. There's a small but real acceleration of ablation of the refusal vector by reducing outer product operations from O(d¬≤√ón) to O(d√ón), and then by pushing said computation layerwise to GPU.
