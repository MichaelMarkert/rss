Would you like to transform your 3D models into stunning animations? This space can help you! ✨ ## 🔍 What Can It Do? This tool converts your uploaded GLB model into: 1. 🎮 A transformed GLB file 2. 🎬 An animated GIF preview 3. 📋 A metadata JSON file ## ✅ Key Features * 🖥️ Works in headless server environments (EGL + pyglet-headless → pyrender fallback) * 🔍 Objects in GIFs appear 3x larger (global scale ×3) * 🎨 Clean interface with pastel background ## 🎮 Animation Types * 🔄 Rotate - Object rotates around the Y-axis * ⬆️ Float - Object moves smoothly up and down * 💥 Explode - Object moves sideways * 🧩 Assemble - Object returns to its original position * 💓 Pulse - Object changes in size * 🔄 Swing - Object swings around the Z-axis ## 🛠️ How to Use 1. Upload your GLB model 📤 2. Select your desired animation type 🎬 3. Adjust the duration and FPS ⏱️ 4. Click the "Generate Animation" button ▶️ 5....</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/766230066345476</guid></item><item><title>Today we launch Dione.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/blaise-tk/108431169603656</link><description>Today we launch Dione. A few months ago it was just a wild idea I shared with @ bygimenez , now it's real. Dione (Beta) is here, the easiest way to discover and install open-source apps, especially AI ones. Think of it as the Steam of open source. Installing open-source tools is often a mess. Dione fixes that. Beautiful UI and workflow. Soon multi-platform, multilingual &amp; fully open-source. Users can even write and share their own installation scripts. This is just the beginning. 🚀 Join our exclusive Beta → https://getdione.app/beta/join See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/blaise-tk/108431169603656</guid></item><item><title>11 Alignment and Optimization Algorithms for LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/849940009274643</link><description>11 Alignment and Optimization Algorithms for LLMs When we need to align models' behavior with the desired objectives, we rely on specialized algorithms that support helpfulness, accuracy, reasoning, safety, and alignment with user preferences. Much of a model’s usefulness comes from post-training optimization methods. Here are the main optimization algorithms (both classic and new) in one place: 1. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) -&gt; Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (1707.06347) Clips the probability ratio to prevent the new policy from diverging too far from the old one. It helps keep everything stable 2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) -&gt; Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model (2305.18290) It's a non RL method, where an LM is an implicit reward model. It uses a simple loss to boost the preferred answer’s probability over the less preferred one 3.

Also Intellite chat technically does work! But we decided to scale it up a bit (same parameter count at 100m, but we went from trained on 4b tokens to 200b tokens, big upgrade!) for max quality.

I have developed a 1-click installers and super advanced Gradio app for this model with so many amazing features. In this tutorial video I will show you how to step by step use this amazing AI tool and generate the very best very high-quality 3D assets locally. Moreover, you can also use this tool on RunPod and Massed Compute as well if you are GPU poor. 🔗Follow below link to download the zip file...</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/718201459901945</guid></item><item><title>I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! 💪</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/347153743407715</link><description>I've made an open version of Google's NotebookLM, and it shows the superiority of the open source tech task! 💪 The app's workflow is simple. Given a source PDF or URL, it extracts the content from it, then tasks Meta's Llama 3.3-70B with writing the podcast script, with a good prompt crafted by @ gabrielchua ("two hosts, with lively discussion, fun notes, insightful question etc.") Then it hands off the text-to-speech conversion to Kokoro-82M, and there you go, you have two hosts discussion any article. The generation is nearly instant, because: &gt; Llama 3.3 70B is running at 1,000 tokens/seconds with Cerebras inference &gt; The audio is generated in streaming mode by the tiny (yet powerful) Kokoro, generating voices faster than real-time. And the audio generation runs for free on Zero GPUs, hosted by HF on H200s. Overall, open source solutions rival the quality of closed-source solutions at close to no cost!

Input: Topics or data sources Processing: Automated deep research Output: multimodal results (such as reports, videos, audio, diagrams) &amp; multi-platform publishing. There is a three-stage process In the initial Stage, output for text-based content in markdown format allows for user review before transformation into various other formats, such as PDF or HTML. The second stage transforms the output into other modalities, like audio, video, diagrams, and translations into different languages. The final stage focuses on publishing multi-modal content across multiple platforms like X, GitHub, Hugging Face, YouTube, and podcasts, etc. See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/VirtualOasis/965866013655862</guid></item><item><title>this book actually exists for free, “the little book of deep learning”. best to refresh your mind about DL basics:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/756119536681094</link><description>this book actually exists for free, “the little book of deep learning”. best to refresh your mind about DL basics: &gt; foundations of machine learning &gt; how models train &gt; common layers (dropout, pooling…) &gt; basic intro to LLMs actually optimized for mobile.
