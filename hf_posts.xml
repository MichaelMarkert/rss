The results did not meet expectations. Veo2 struggled with style consistency and temporal coherence, falling behind competitors like Runway, Pika, Tencent, and even Alibaba. While the model shows promise, its alignment and quality are not yet there. Google recently launched Veo2, its latest text-to-video model, through select partners like fal.ai. As part of our ongoing evaluation of state-of-the-art generative video models, we rigorously benchmarked Veo2 against industry leaders. We generated a large set of Veo2 videos spending hundreds of dollars in the process and systematically evaluated them using our Python-based API for human and automated labeling.

You can see it on this view: any provider that does not have a "Billing disabled" badge, is PAYG-compatible.

And even we were mind-blown by the results we got with this latest model we're releasing: ⚡️OlympicCoder ( open-r1/OlympicCoder-7B and open-r1/OlympicCoder-32B ) It's beating Claude 3.7 on (competitive) programming –a domain Anthropic has been historically really strong at– and it's getting close to o1-mini/R1 on olympiad level coding with just 7B parameters! And the best part is that we're open-sourcing all about its training dataset, the new IOI benchmark, and more in our Open-R1 progress report #3: https://huggingface.co/blog/open-r1/update-3 Datasets are are releasing: - open-r1/codeforces - open-r1/codeforces-cots - open-r1/ioi - open-r1/ioi-test-cases - open-r1/ioi-sample-solutions - open-r1/ioi-cots - open-r1/ioi-2024-model-solutions See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:29:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/thomwolf/597591144299421</guid></item><item><title>🔥The Open R1 team just dropped OlympicCoder and it's wild:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/732602870953765</link><description>🔥The Open R1 team just dropped OlympicCoder and it's wild: - 7B model outperforms Claude 3.7 Sonnet on IOI benchmark (yes, 7B!!) - 32B crushes all open-weight models tested, even those 100x larger 🤯 Open-sourcing the future of code reasoning! 🚀 Check it out https://huggingface.co/blog/open-r1/update-3 See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:29:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/732602870953765</guid></item></channel></rss>
