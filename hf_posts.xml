JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, a self-supervised learning framework that predicts the latent representation of a missing part of the input. Here are 11 JEPA types that you should know about: 1. V-JEPA 2 -&gt; V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning (2506.09985) Trained on 1M+ hours of internet videos and a little bit of robot interaction data, V-JEPA 2 can watch, understand, answer questions, and help robots plan and act in physical world 2. Time-Series-JEPA (TS-JEPA) -&gt; Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks (2406.04853) It's a time-series predictive model that learns compact, meaningful representations. A self-supervised semantic actor then uses them to generate control commands without raw data 3.
