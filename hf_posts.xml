First and foremost, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude for Hugging Face's continuous support and efforts. üíô Our Openfree AI collaborates with various AI communities across Korea, contributing to knowledge sharing and ecosystem development. ü§ù I've been actively promoting the critical importance of Hugging Face as Korea's AI infrastructure backbone, engaging with senior government officials, National Assembly members, university leaders, and media executives to emphasize how Hugging Face represents Korea's AI future at a national policy level. I consider myself a 'voluntary Korean ambassador for Hugging Face'. üá∞üá∑‚ú® Let me share our community's achievements on the Hugging Face platform over the past year: üéØ üöÄ Published hundreds of models and spaces üë• Surpassed 10 million cumulative visitors üìà Achieved 1.7 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) üé® Generated over 1 million images/videos per month These...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/428786122279500</guid></item><item><title>Recently, I've been focusing my learning on the following topics:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283</link><description>Recently, I've been focusing my learning on the following topics: - Pytorch internals, specifically the inductor system (roughly ~1 month of experience) - Triton internals (~8 moe) - CUDA (~3 moe) - Understanding fusion patterns in compilers and how to improve them (~1 moe) - Parallelism strategies for large scale inference optimization (~6-7 moe) I thought it would be nice to document it somewhere for no particular reason. Maybe someone will find it useful? It's also because I want to get into the habit of writing, but had no motivation to do so. Maybe writing short informal posts will help build the habit. Since I don't have a personal site, and don't plan to create one in the near future, I think HF posts are best suited for short and informal documentation to share my little discoveries and learnings. If you're interested, strap in! First post in this series will be on basic study of Pytorch's float32 matmuls and their Triton implementation (nothing much, just the tutorial...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/231008365980283</guid></item><item><title>Has anyone ever backed up a model to a sequential tape drive, or I'm the world first? :D</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/csabakecskemeti/762115035937109</link><description>Has anyone ever backed up a model to a sequential tape drive, or I'm the world first? :D Just played around with my retro PC that has got a tape drive‚Äîdid it just because I can.

His model achieved perfect real-world detection accuracy without a single real image in the training loop. In this blog, Dr. Sanz walks us through his method, which includes the design and training of an advanced pipeline to achieve 100% detection accuracy. His full technical breakdown covers: üìç Synthetic-only training üìç Data augmentation with an ensemble learning approach for better generalization üìç Custom occlusion generation üìç A Faster R-CNN model fine-tuned with Falcon generated data üìç And much more! The results speak for themselves! üìñ Read the blog here: https://www.duality.ai/blog/leveraging-synthetic-data-for-real-world-object-detection Congratulations Sergio!

The core question we investigated: Can specialized behaviors typically acquired through expensive supervised fine-tuning be elicited from base models without any parameter updates? Our theoretical contribution: We provide a formal proof, grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, showing that this is indeed possible under certain assumptions. The work establishes mathematical bounds on the minimal dataset sizes needed for approximation. Key theoretical results: - For text generation tasks: O(mV/Œµ¬≤) examples suffice (where m = number of contexts, V = vocabulary size, Œµ = error tolerance) - For linear classification: O(d/Œµ) examples (where d = input...</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/378799954783125</guid></item><item><title>I created a collection of FLUX.1 models but 4x faster</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davidberenstein1957/888709551300235</link><description>I created a collection of FLUX.1 models but 4x faster PrunaAI/flux1-but-4x-faster-66c0b7340836dd7a55e9c0ea See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:23:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/davidberenstein1957/888709551300235</guid></item><item><title>Super excited to release Autotrain MCP.

This is an MCP server for training AI models, so you can use your AI tools to train your AI models ü§Ø. üîó burtenshaw/autotrain-mcp Use this MCP server with tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, VSCode, or Continue to do this: - Define an ML problem like Image Classification, LLM fine-tuning, Text Classification, etc. - The AI can retrieve models and datasets from the hub using the hub MCP. - Training happens on a Hugging Face space, so no worries about hardware restraints. - Models are pushed to the hub to be used inference tools like Llama.cpp, vLLM, MLX, etc. - Built on top of the AutoTrain library, so it has full integration with transformers and other libraries. Everything is still under active development, but I‚Äôm super excited to hear what people build, and I‚Äôm open to contributions!
