And they acted - run and jump - better than Optimus. Why can human own cat and dog? Maybe we have better LLM model in brain than that of cat and dog? 猫和狗都拥有像人类一样的强化学习能力、视觉和听觉。而且它们跑跳等方面的表现甚至比擎天柱还要出色。为什么人类可以饲养猫和狗呢？或许我们的大脑拥有比猫狗更优秀的大语言模型？ See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/431236892313740</guid></item><item><title>No SOTA from gpt5 codex</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/122975793150084</link><description>No SOTA from gpt5 codex onekq-ai/WebApp1K-models-leaderboard See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/122975793150084</guid></item><item><title>Try the demo of NVIDIA Nemotron Parse v1.1, NVIDIA's latest VLM for understanding document semantics and extracting text and table elements with spatial grounding.

I’m trying to publish my new AI research paper on arXiv under the cs.AI category, but I currently need an endorser who is already authorized for cs.AI submissions. If anyone here is registered as a cs.AI endorser and is willing to help, I would truly appreciate it. Here is the official arXiv endorsement request link: 🔗 https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=EZEMO7 (Backup: http://arxiv.org/auth/endorse.php — Code: EZEMO7) My research: It’s part of the AetherMind project — a self-reflective NLI reasoning system inspired by human cognitive consistency and used also in Alzheimer’s research. If needed, I can share the abstract or full PDF. Thank you so much to anyone who can support. — Sameer S.Najm See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/574430859110807</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Reference: *Atlas of Structured Intelligence*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/443085216876424</link><description>✅ New Reference: *Atlas of Structured Intelligence* Title: 🗺️ Atlas of Structured Intelligence 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/atlas-of-structured-intelligence --- Summary: Across 40+ articles, PoCs (education, computing, space), specs, and the Cosmic Intelligence Model, this *Atlas* is the navigation layer: it locates each piece, shows recurring protocols, and connects micro (cognition) → meso (institutions) → macro (civilization) → cosmic (CIM). *It’s the map of the series itself, not a new theory.* &gt; From fragments to framework — &gt; *the Atlas turns a library into a system.* --- Why It Matters: • Gives newcomers a clear entry path; gives experts cross-links and dependencies • Reveals protocol reuse across domains (not just “themes,” but shared machinery) • Bridges qualitative ideas with quantitative indices and evaluation --- What’s Inside: • *Macro Map:* Core theory → applied domains → PoC suite → cosmic series • *Protocol Matrix:* Where jump-generator, memory-loop,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/443085216876424</guid></item><item><title>@Reubencf</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mybbnae/820891401991666</link><description>@ Reubencf made an WebOS check it out MCP-1st-Birthday/Reuben_OS See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mybbnae/820891401991666</guid></item></channel></rss>
