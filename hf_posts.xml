Right now, I‚Äôm focusing on educational stuff and getting loads of new people to build open AI models using free and open source tools. I‚Äôve made a collection of some of the tools I‚Äôm building and using for teaching. Stuff like quizzes, code challenges, and certificates. burtenshaw/tools-for-learning-ai-6797453caae193052d3638e2 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/555593095351748</guid></item><item><title>Introducing VLM-R1!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/tianchez/384417618281589</link><description>Introducing VLM-R1! GRPO has helped DeepSeek R1 to learn reasoning. Can it also help VLMs perform stronger for general computer vision tasks? The answer is YES and it generalizes better than SFT. We trained Qwen 2.5 VL 3B on RefCOCO (a visual grounding task) and eval on RefCOCO Val and RefGTA (an OOD task). https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VLM-R1 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tianchez/384417618281589</guid></item><item><title>I was thinking i need to step up my game on training Flux LoRas models, time to have some fun ! ‚òÄÔ∏è</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fffiloni/806803691807876</link><description>I was thinking i need to step up my game on training Flux LoRas models, time to have some fun ! ‚òÄÔ∏è Expect a new drop per week on aesthetics that catched my attention, here are 3 of them that worked really well ! fffiloni/cute-comic-800 fffiloni/carbo-800 fffiloni/oniric-750 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fffiloni/806803691807876</guid></item><item><title>Your weekly recap of open AI is here, and it's packed with models!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/171433424068357</link><description>Your weekly recap of open AI is here, and it's packed with models! merve/feb-14-releases-67af876b404cc27c6d837767 üëÄ Multimodal &gt; OpenGVLab released InternVideo 2.5 Chat models, new video LMs with long context &gt; AIDC released Ovis2 model family along with Ovis dataset, new vision LMs in different sizes (1B, 2B, 4B, 8B, 16B, 34B), with video and OCR support &gt; ColQwenStella-2b is a multilingual visual retrieval model that is sota in it's size &gt; Hoags-2B-Exp is a new multilingual vision LM with contextual reasoning, long context video understanding üí¨ LLMs A lot of math models! &gt; Open-R1 team released OpenR1-Math-220k large scale math reasoning dataset, along with Qwen2.5-220K-Math fine-tuned on the dataset, OpenR1-Qwen-7B &gt; Nomic AI released new Nomic Embed multilingual retrieval model, a MoE with 500 params with 305M active params, outperforming other models &gt; DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview is a new DeepSeek-R1-Distill fine-tune using distributed RL on math &gt; LIMO is a new fine-tune of...</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/171433424068357</guid></item><item><title>hello, dev mode explorers!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nroggendorff/464265972064174</link><description>hello, dev mode explorers!

I fine-tuned HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M to generate one-line summaries from a model or dataset README. Its own self-description? "A model for generating concise summaries of model &amp; dataset cards from the Hugging Face Hub" The goal? Make it easier to find the right models and datasets for your specific needs. It's already powering a semantic search for datasets Space. It's still a WIP but thanks to @ loubnabnl , @ anton-l , @ eliebak et al, for cooking such a nice base model for fine-tuning small, efficient models for specific domains and tasks. üôè See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/966932095656116</guid></item><item><title>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</link><description>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM: =&gt; Just replace "github" with "gitingest" in the url, and you get the whole repo as a single string that you can then paste in your LLMs See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</guid></item></channel></rss>
