Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded &gt;270...</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 05:22:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495</guid></item><item><title>Say hello to my little friends!

Three is always better than one! 3x AMD Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 384GB RAM 24TB of RAID storage Ubuntu 24.04 ROCm 7.0.2 llama cpp, vLLM and Aibrix Small, cheap GPUs are about to become the Raspberry Pi of edge AI inference. Sprinkle some kubectl fairy dust on top, and suddenly it's a high-availability, self-healing, cloud-native, enterprise-grade AI cluster camping in a closet. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it’s aligned with the company that owns it.

This precision gripper offers parallel jaw movement, real-time monitoring, and positioning accuracy of ±0.1°, making it ideal for both robotics enthusiasts and professionals. Complete build cost: Just $69.45–$74.45, with all components available for purchase on Amazon. Direct links are provided in the Bill of Materials on GitHub. Check out the project on github: https://github.com/roboninecom/3D-Printed-Parallel-Gripper-for-Robotics-Arms We encourage you to Watch, Fork, and Star the repository to support our open-source initiative and stay updated on future developments. Your feedback is also welcome!

This is Glyph, Zai’s new visual-text compression voodoo: • 10 k words → 3 PNGs ≈ 3 k visual tokens • Compression ratio: 4.3× • Throughput: 40-60 tok/s i.e. your context window now finishes before my coffee does So I did the only reasonable thing: asked GLM-4.6 to port Glyph for Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking. Translation: I made one model compress a novel into a comic strip, then made another model read the comic strip and still ace QA. It’s basically passing notes in class, except the note is a 1920×1080 meme and the teacher is a transformer. We've gone from "Attention is All You Need" to "Attention is Too Expensive, Just Use Your Eyes." Remember kids: in 2025 literacy is optional, but JPEG is forever.

"𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗜𝘀 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱"! 🥳 FineVision: Open Data Is All You Need (2510.17269) If you've ever trained a VLM, you know this problem: nobody shares their data mixtures. It's a black box, making replicating SOTA work impossible. We wanted to change that. FineVision unifies 200 sources into 24 million samples. With 17.3 million images and 9.5 billion answer tokens, it's the largest open resource of its kind. In the paper, we share how we built it: 🔍 finding and cleaning data at scale 🧹 removing excessive duplicates across sources 🤗 decontaminating against 66 public benchmarks My favorite part is Figure 6 (in the video!). It's our visual diversity analysis. It shows that FineVision isn't just bigger; it's more balanced and conceptually richer than other open datasets. NVIDIA's Eagle 2 paper highlighted just how critical this visual diversity is, and our results confirm it: models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on...</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 05:22:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/792285802244623</guid></item><item><title>Qwen3-VL-4B is incredibly easy to fine-tune!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/paulml/601253280118572</link><description>Qwen3-VL-4B is incredibly easy to fine-tune! We've trained the first DSE model based on this model, and it's already performing at the same level as Jina v4! While Jina Embeddings v4 is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B (which has a non-commercial license), our model is based on Qwen3-VL-4B and released under Apache 2.0—making it fully commercially permissive.

Here who is gaining the most: SelmaNajih001/InvestmentStrategyBasedOnSentiment The Space uses titles from this dataset: 📊 SelmaNajih001/Cnbc_MultiCompany Given a news title, it calculates a sentiment score : if the score crosses a certain threshold, the strategy decides to buy or sell. Each trade lasts one day, and the strategy then computes the daily return. For Tesla the best model seems to be the regression 👀 Just a quick note: the model uses the closing price as the buy price, meaning it already reflects the impact of the news.
