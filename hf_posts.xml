Apologies for the delay, but we‚Äôre stoked to finally drop this, even in its alpha stage. Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. **No commercial use yet**: We're still working on Deca 2.5 (Proprietary), and releasing Deca 3 for commercial use right now would impact that. Once Deca 3.5 hits in early '26, we‚Äôll be opening it up with a more permissive license. 2. **Built on existing models**: Deca 3 isn‚Äôt a ground-up creation‚Äîit‚Äôs a huge step forward, building on what‚Äôs already out there. 3. **It‚Äôs experimental**: As much as we‚Äôre hyped about its scale, it‚Äôs still in testing. 4. **DynaMoE architecture**: Run a (very) small part of the model with 64GB of RAM/VRAM (when quantized - quants coming soon), or the whole thing with 1TB. It‚Äôs that scalable. 5. **Not widely...</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:17:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ccocks-deca/499605656909204</guid></item><item><title>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE ü§ó</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZacMasa5000/133834634332701</link><description>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE ü§ó In this dataset, you‚Äôll find 20,000+ rows of the top trending posts on X over the past several weeks. üî•Topics Include: üîπBitcoin üîπGPT-5 üîπGrok üîπCursor üîπAI, Agents + Prompts üîπChainlink $LINK üìÇDownload dataset!

Many users have noticed that GPT-5 feels less approachable than o4 when it comes to emotional conversations. But what does that actually mean in practice, especially when users seek support or share vulnerabilities with an AI? To dig into this question, we built the AI Companionship Leaderboard: frimelle/companionship-leaderboard The leaderboard compares models on how often their responses reinforce companionship across four dimensions: ‚ú® Assistant Traits ‚Äì How the assistant presents its personality and role. ‚ú® Relationship &amp; Intimacy ‚Äì Whether it frames the interaction in terms of closeness or bonding. ‚ú® Emotional Investment ‚Äì How far it goes in engaging emotionally when asked. ‚ú® User Vulnerabilities ‚Äì How it responds when users disclose struggles or difficulties. üìä You can explore how models differ, request new ones to be added, and see which ones are more likely to encourage (or resist) companionship-seeking behaviors.

BUT (pun not intended) there's been a minor logic error in how we store session data for custom prompting for our presets feature. - While we can't deny that we all like nice buttocks as natural human beings, for the time being please reset the prompts to the default state after use, just as a courtesy for the next user. - As long as you are staying within the law and HF's terms of service, we do not judge for curious minds and the inevitable occasional ... urges driven by humanly hormones, which, our future AGI overlords will never have. The session storage logic error is completely on me, and will be fixed tomorrow, after I get some sleep as I am severely sleep-deprived (unrelated reasons) and my brain is pretty much mush.
