This week, let's spotlight some powerful techniques that have shown promise in helping LLMs achieve more consistent logic, planning, and depth: 1. Retrieval-Augmented CoT Chaining (RAG+CoT) -&gt; CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models (2504.13534) Combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with retrieval augmentation at intermediate steps. Relevant documents are fetched after each reasoning subgoal, updating context dynamically. Great for open-domain QA, math, logic and multi-hop fact-checking 2. Tool-use by example injection -&gt; Self-Training Large Language Models for Tool-Use Without Demonstrations (2502.05867) Injects few-shot tool interaction examples during training to implicitly teach calling patterns. Helps in plug-and-play tool use without training new...</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 05:39:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/930317125764918</guid></item><item><title>Release picks of the past week is here!

For this research assistant, I've chosen to focus exclusively on OpenAI models for several key reasons: - Reliability &amp; Consistency: OpenAI's models provide consistent, high-quality responses that are crucial for research tasks requiring accuracy and depth. - Advanced Reasoning: Models like GPT-4o and o1-preview excel at complex analytical thinking, making them ideal for comprehensive research synthesis and evaluation. - Proven Performance: The research pipeline has been extensively tested and optimised specifically for OpenAI's model behaviours and capabilities. - API...</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 05:39:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mallocode200/392195427390890</guid></item></channel></rss>
