Then the training is sequential 🔢 : 1. Freeze the LLM weights while you train the ViT only to work with the LLM part, then 2. Unfreeze all weights to train all weights in order to work together. 💫 The Shanghai Lab decided to challenge this paradigm and chose this approach that they call "native". For each of their model sizes, they still start from a good LLM (mostly Qwen-2.5 series, did I tell you I'm a huge fan of Qwen? ❤️), and stitch the ViT, but they don't freeze anything : they train all weights together with interleaved text and image...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/531366391123392</guid></item><item><title>Dropping an entire collection of Style Intermixing Adapters on StrangerZone HF — including Realism, Anime, Sketch, Texture-Rich 3D Experimentals, Automotive Concept Images, and LoRA models based on Flux.1, SD 3.5 Turbo/Large, Stable Diffusion XL 🎨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/567717355691306</link><description>Dropping an entire collection of Style Intermixing Adapters on StrangerZone HF — including Realism, Anime, Sketch, Texture-Rich 3D Experimentals, Automotive Concept Images, and LoRA models based on Flux.1, SD 3.5 Turbo/Large, Stable Diffusion XL 🎨 ╰┈➤Collection : ➜ sketch : strangerzonehf/sketch-fav-675ba869c7ceaec7e652ee1c ➜ sketch2 : strangerzonehf/q-series-sketch-678e3503bf3a661758429717 ➜ automotive : strangerzonehf/automotive-3d-675bb31a491d8c264d45d843 ➜ texture 3d : strangerzonehf/flux-3dxl-engine-674833c14a001d5b1fdb5139 ➜ super 3d : strangerzonehf/super-3d-engine-6743231d69f496df97addd2b ➜ style mix : strangerzonehf/mixer-engine-673582c9c5939d8aa5bf9533 ➜ realism : strangerzonehf/realism-engine-67343495b6daf0fbdb904cc1 ╰┈➤The Entire Collection : ➜ flux.1 : prithivMLmods/flux-lora-collections-66dd5908be2206cfaa8519be ➜ flux-ultimate-lora-collection : strangerzonehf/Flux-Ultimate-LoRA-Collection ➜ sd 3.5 large / turbo : prithivMLmods/sd-35-large-lora-671b39d7bc2e7f71a446b163...</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/567717355691306</guid></item><item><title>🦅 SmolLM2-Eagle Collection -</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nyuuzyou/125489545915443</link><description>🦅 SmolLM2-Eagle Collection - nyuuzyou/smollm2-eagle-680263bf97f0c7e6bbe4936b Collection of fine-tuned bilingual language models featuring: - Models in three parameter sizes: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B based on HuggingFaceTB's SmolLM2 models - Both standard and GGUF formats for flexible deployment in llama.cpp and Ollama - Fine-tuned on nyuuzyou/EagleSFT dataset (536,231 Russian-English QA pairs derived from 739k+ real user queries) - Experimental Russian language capabilities while maintaining English performance - Limited Russian capabilities due to SFT-only approach without Russian pre-training - Environmental impact: ~19.75 kg CO2eq This collection provides compact models for research on bilingual language capabilities, resource-constrained environments, and educational applications.

It has 130 different tasks grouped into 8 categories, like image search, classification, clustering similar images, answering questions based on images, and understanding documents. It even covers 38 different languages. The authors tested 50 models and found that no single model was best at everything. Some models were great at recognizing text inside images but struggled to handle complicated tasks like matching images and text that appear together.
