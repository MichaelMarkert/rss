Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -&gt; InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -&gt; CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -&gt; ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 05:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893</guid></item><item><title>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/406218973183679</link><description>📊 Papers Impact: Instant AI Grading for Your Research Papers! 🚀 🌟 Introduction Hello, AI research community! 🎉 Introducing Papers Impact - the revolutionary AI tool that automatically grades and predicts the potential impact of research papers! 🧠💡 VIDraft/PapersImpact ✨ Key Feature: Instant Paper Grading The core functionality is brilliantly simple: Just enter an arXiv paper ID or URL, and our AI instantly analyzes and grades the paper's potential academic impact!

We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!
