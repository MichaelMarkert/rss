We've worked to integrate the three frameworks in distinctive ways so that learners can reflect on when and where to use each. This also means that you can follow the course if you're already familiar with one of these frameworks, and soak up some of the fundamental knowledge in earlier units. Hopefully, this makes the agents course as open to as many people as possible.

The main one is that we have designed a CUDA kernel to expand the Flash Attention by @ tridao with RPE biases and supports other PE such as RoPE, ALiBi or FIRE. The result kernel is 2 times faster than a SPDA implementation. We also use Triton kernels to optimize certain parts of the architecture, such as the cross-entropy and RMSNorm layer. The various kernels have been carefully built to be compatible with BF16 and torch.compile to go even faster and achieve efficient pretraining. All other optimizations are described in a üìù subsequent blog post available on @ huggingface ü§ó: CATIE-AQ/FAT5-report . This methodology enabled us to efficiently pretrain as a proof of concept a FAT5 with 147M parameters in French in a reasonable time (1,461H for 419B tokens), with limited resources (1 A100 i.e. a...</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:23:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lbourdois/751427866406946</guid></item><item><title>Play with Orpheus TTS, a Llama-based Speech-LLM designed for high-quality, empathetic text-to-speech generation.

Context: AlexNet had a historic win in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), reducing error rate from 26% (previous best) to 15.3%. It‚Äôs a deep CNN with 8 layers (5 convolutional + 3 fully connected), pioneering the use of ReLU activations for faster training, dropout for regularization, and GPU acceleration for large-scale learning. This moment marked the beginning of the deep learning revolution, inspiring architectures like VGG, ResNet, and modern transformers.

It is not the worst model according to AHA leaderboard and it is one of the smart according to lmarena.ai. My objective is to make it based, anti woke, wise, beneficial and then some. Several GPUs are fine tuning it at the same time, each using a different dataset and using QLoRA and the successful ones are merged later. Compared to LoRa this allows faster training and also reduced overfitting because the merge operation heals overfitting. The problem with this could be the 4 bit quantization may make models dumber. But I am not looking for sheer IQ. Too much mind is a problem anyway :) Has anyone tried parallel QLoRa and merge before? I also automated the dataset selection and benchmarking and converging to objectives (the fit function, the reward). It is basically trying to get higher score in AHA Leaderboard as fast as possible with a diverse set of organisms that "evolve by training". I want to release some cool stuff when...</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:23:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/560030136297214</guid></item></channel></rss>
