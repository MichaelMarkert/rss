Just tested it with Steve Jobs' Stanford speech and was speechless (pun intended). The video isn’t sped up. 3 things that floored me: - Transcription took just 10 seconds for a 15-min file - Got a CSV with perfect timestamps, punctuation &amp; capitalization - Stunning accuracy (correctly captured "Reed College" and other specifics) NVIDIA also released a demo where you can click any transcribed segment to play it instantly. The improvement is significant: number 1 on the ASR Leaderboard, 6% error rate (best in class) with complete commercial freedom (cc-by-4.0 license). Time to update those Whisper pipelines! H/t @ Steveeeeeeen for the finding!

My experience, however, is that context management is vastly more important with them. If you use a client with a typical session log with rolling compression, a Qwen 3 model will start to generate the same messages over and over. I don't think that detracts from them. They're optimized for a more advanced MCP environment. I honestly think the 8B is optimal for home use, given proper RAG/CAG. In typical session chats, Lamarck and Chocolatine are still my daily drives. I worked hard to give Lamarck v0.7 a sprinkling of CoT from both DRT and Deepseek R1. While those models got surpassed on the leaderboards, in practice, I still really enjoy their output. My projects are focusing on application and context management, because that's where the payoff in improved quality is right now. But should there be a mix of finetunes to make just the right mix of - my recipes are standing by.

In response to that, I'm happy to present my final submission to the Reasoning Dataset Competition and attempt to start benchmarking the ability of LLMs to identify unsafe and / or exploitable code by way of the CoSa (Code Safety) benchmark: ZennyKenny/cosa-benchmark-dataset Currently a curated set of 200 examples, calibrated on OpenAI's standard issue models (GPT-4.1, o4 mini, and GPT-3.5 Turbo) as "baseline performance" (70% decile).

But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today. Here's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches: 1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -&gt; Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (2504.20769) Provides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs 2. Hybrid-CoT -&gt; AdaR1: From Long-CoT to Hybrid-CoT via Bi-Level Adaptive Reasoning Optimization (2504.21659) Proposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles 3.
