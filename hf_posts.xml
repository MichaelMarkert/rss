How it works: The tool exposes the standard discover/info/resources/validate actions. Skills live in /Skills under the same File_System root, and any bundled scripts run through Shell_Command , no new infrastructure required. Agent_Skills(action= "discover" ) # List all available skills Agent_Skills(action= "info" , skill_name= "music-downloader" ) # Full SKILL.md Agent_Skills(action= "resources" , skill_name= "music-downloader" ) # Scripts, refs, assets I've included a music-downloader skill as a working demo, it wraps yt-dlp for YouTube/SoundCloud audio extraction. Caveat: On HF Spaces, Shell_Command works for most tasks, but some operations (like YouTube downloads) are restricted due to the container environment. For full functionality, run the server locally on your machine.

The platform already has a ton of great integrations that let you interact with your external apps directly with tools, but I wanted to add the ability to do stuff in Slack as well. 💪 So I took the base Anthropic Slack MCP server, added a whole bunch of new tools, and generalized it as an HTTP-based SSE-server and deployed it in like 2 minutes with Railway so that Strawberry could make use of it (as can Claude or any other MCP client). Now, you can Chat with your Strawberry Companion (or Claude, or whatever) and do things like: ➡️ Get caught up across all of your Slack channels after a long weekend or noisy incident without having to read 20 threads in 10 different channels ➡️ Create, read, and edit Canvases, Messages, and Channels ➡️ Take any resources or content that you're using in your Chat and inject it directly into Slack without copy / paste 😎 I'm...</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:25:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/672558817086708</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Z Image Turbo LoRA DLC App, a gallery space for plug-and-play Z-Image-Turbo LoRAs.
