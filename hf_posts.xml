My skepticism circuits overloaded, but my local AI FOMO module screamed louder. I've thrown this 33B monoblock LLM onto a single GPU and used Roo Code for some… let’s call it “vibe testing”. It’s terrifyingly competent. As an architect, it’s the best open-weight model I’ve touched this side of 2025.

Key results: Qwen3-0.6B: 63.2 → 66.0 on MATH-500 (+4%) Gemma3-1B: 41.0 → 45.6 on MATH-500 (+11%) The method extracts coherent reasoning patterns from one model via Internal Coherence Maximization, converts them to DPO training data, and uses that to improve a completely different model architecture. This goes beyond the original ICM paper which only improved models using their own labels. We're showing you can transfer capabilities between any models - imagine extracting capabilities from strong models to improve your local ones.

They're gen AI systems that help models and agents learn internal representations of real-world environments. Today, we invite you to take a look at 12 standout examples: 1. WorldVLA → WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model (2506.21539) This autoregressive world model integrates action prediction and visual world modeling in a single framework, allowing each to enhance the other. It introduces an attention masking strategy to reduce action prediction errors 2. SimuRA → https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773 A generalized world model that uses a language-based world model to simulate and plan actions before execution, enabling more general and flexible reasoning 3.

It works by iterating over an existing HF dataset and by using a LLM to create completions. - Problem: You need a fast way to create custom datasets for fine-tuning or RAG, but you want the flexibility to use different LLM backends or your own infrastructure. - Solution: Completionist connects with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including Ollama and LM Studio, or a Hugging Face inference endpoint. A simple CLI like Completionist gives you the possibility to take full control of your synthetic data generation workflow. 👉 Check out Completionist on GitHub: https://github.com/ethicalabs-ai/completionist Synthetic Dataset Example: ethicalabs/kurtis-mental-health-v2-sft-reasoning See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 13:45:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/268112975581936</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 Is Here</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/625756342268823</link><description>🚀 Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 Is Here The Intermediate Thinking Model just leveled up again.

Our key findings from 29 experiments across 10 models: - Gemini Flash 2.5 achieved 2.04x speedup across 30 benchmark tasks - Open models like Gemma 3 27B (1.63x) and Qwen3-Coder 480B (1.41x) rivaled proprietary models - The system discovered entirely new algorithms - not just code optimizations! - One task evolved from DFS to BFS to Union-Find approaches - Specialized coding models outperformed much larger general models 200 iterations beat 100 iterations by 24% - Ensembles surprisingly failed due to conflicting optimization strategies Most fascinating: watching models evolve code step-by-step, like transforming matrix operations from basic eigendecomposition to vectorized one-liners with 32x speedup.
