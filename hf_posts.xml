How it works: The tool exposes the standard discover/info/resources/validate actions. Skills live in /Skills under the same File_System root, and any bundled scripts run through Shell_Command , no new infrastructure required. Agent_Skills(action= "discover" ) # List all available skills Agent_Skills(action= "info" , skill_name= "music-downloader" ) # Full SKILL.md Agent_Skills(action= "resources" , skill_name= "music-downloader" ) # Scripts, refs, assets I've included a music-downloader skill as a working demo, it wraps yt-dlp for YouTube/SoundCloud audio extraction. Caveat: On HF Spaces, Shell_Command works for most tasks, but some operations (like YouTube downloads) are restricted due to the container environment. For full functionality, run the server locally on your machine.

Relying on cloud-hosted LLMs is often overkill. While frontier models still lead in complex coding, local models are now more than capable of handling many agentic workflows—with zero latency and total privacy. To help bridge the gap between local inference and usable agents, I’m releasing agent.cpp: https://github.com/mozilla-ai/agent.cpp It provides minimal, high-performance building blocks for agents in C++, built directly around the awesome llama.cpp ecosystem. Stop sending your data to a remote API. Start building and running agents on your own hardware.
