Also, don't comment about how unlikely this is. I've gotten a warning email about a token I 'leaked' at least four times. In all cases, it has been in the digest hash.

These models only had their text models quantized, and had a 50% model size reduction (4GB~2GB) while keeping model degradation under 1% on the DocVQA benchmark. #huggingface #smolvlm #smollm ronantakizawa/SmolVLM-Instruct-awq ronantakizawa/SmolVLM-Instruct-gptq See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 05:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/523357349957866</guid></item><item><title>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/umarbutler/611899757397292</link><description>I'm excited to announce the release of Kanon 2 Embedder, the world's best legal embedding model, ranked first on the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark 🎉 This model is the product of quite literally months of painstaking work alongside @ abdurrahmanbutler collecting, cleaning, and processing terabytes of data as well as coming up with novel improvements to the standard embedder training recipe to push the limits of what's possible. Kanon 2 Embedder is my most advanced model to date. On MLEB, it benchmarks as 9% more accurate than OpenAI's best embedding model and 30% faster. Even when truncated from 1,792 to 768 dimensions, Kanon 2 Embedder continues to hold the number one spot on MLEB. Importantly, Kanon 2 Embedder is also privacy and security friendly — unlike Voyage, Cohere and Jina, none of your data is used to train our models by default. Kanon 2 Embedder can also be self-hosted for enterprises with heightened security or reliability requirements.

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐋𝐄𝐁 — 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤. A suite of 10 high-quality English legal IR datasets, designed by legal experts to set a new standard for comparing embedding models. Whether you’re exploring legal RAG on your home computer, or running enterprise-scale retrieval, apples-to-apples evaluation is crucial. That’s why we’ve open-sourced everything - including our 7 brand-new, hand-crafted retrieval datasets. All of these datasets are now live on Hugging Face. Any guesses which embedding model leads on legal retrieval? 𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐭: it’s not OpenAI or Google - they place 7th and 9th on our leaderboard. To do well on MLEB, embedding models must demonstrate both extensive legal domain knowledge and strong legal reasoning skills. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 05:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abdurrahmanbutler/994710514786612</guid></item><item><title>MLEB  is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</link><description>MLEB is the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive benchmark for legal text embedding models. https://huggingface.co/blog/isaacus/introducing-mleb See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 05:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/adlumal/955872232459431</guid></item><item><title>🌾3LC Cotton Weed Detection Challenge 🌾</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/3LC/214584137705676</link><description>🌾3LC Cotton Weed Detection Challenge 🌾 We’re excited to announce the launch of the 3LC Cotton Weed Detection Challenge—now live on Kaggle! Build a production-ready weed detector under real-world constraints: small models &amp; imperfect labels—the conditions production AI teams face every day. Your mission • Detect &amp; classify 3 weed species in cotton fields: Carpetweed, Morning Glory, Palmer Amaranth • Train with YOLOv8n @ 640 (fixed model size). Tune augmentation &amp; hyperparameters, but no larger models, ensembles, or stacking allowed • Confront imperfect labels (missed weeds, class confusion, uneven boxes)—exactly what real teams face Prizes (USD $2,000 total) 🥇$1,000 • 🥈 $500• 🥉 $250 • 🎨 $250 Most Creative Solution (shareable across up to 5 teams) Plus: winner &amp; participation certificates, LinkedIn shoutouts, and community recognition. What you’ll learn • Developing AI under strict resource constraints • Data-centric techniques to detect &amp; correct label issues • Designing an iterative...</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 05:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/3LC/214584137705676</guid></item><item><title>New drop! 💥 The VLM Object Understanding Comparison Space now runs with Qwen3-VL-4B and moondream3.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/245018487363673</link><description>New drop! 💥 The VLM Object Understanding Comparison Space now runs with Qwen3-VL-4B and moondream3.
