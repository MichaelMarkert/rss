We've trained the first DSE model based on this model, and it's already performing at the same level as Jina v4! While Jina Embeddings v4 is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B (which has a non-commercial license), our model is based on Qwen3-VL-4B and released under Apache 2.0‚Äîmaking it fully commercially permissive.

They can help you capture what‚Äôs happening in AI from multiple angles: 1. Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again) ‚Üí https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ Unveils Software 3.0 ‚Äì a paradigm where LLMs are the new computers, programmed with prompts instead of code. The key: developers must now master coding, training, and prompting as AI becomes the heart of software building 2. Richard Sutton, The OaK Architecture: A Vision of SuperIntelligence from Experience ‚Üí https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbbGyNkR2U Unveils the OaK (Options and Knowledge) architecture ‚Äì a model-based RL framework for continual intelligence, where every component learns, meta-learns &amp; builds hierarchical abstractions 3.

Inspired by Meta's CWM (Code World Model) research, this LoRA adapter adds execution awareness to Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507. The model learns to predict variable states, trace program execution step-by-step, and debug code by understanding runtime behavior. üîç Key Innovation: We combine Qwen3's native thinking capabilities with real Python execution traces captured via sys.settrace(). The model is trained using GRPO with a custom reward function that scores execution prediction accuracy. üìä Training Approach: - Hybrid Magpie-style code generation - Real execution tracing for ground truth - Self-supervised learning (no manual annotations!) - 298 training samples with execution traces ‚ú® What it does: - Predicts variable states at each line of code - Explains execution flow with thinking tags - Helps debug by understanding...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 05:23:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/654123549897898</guid></item><item><title>ü§ñ New article: In-depth testing of the Feetech STS3215 servomotor ‚Äî the popular choice for open-source robotic projects like SO-ARM 100 and others.

The post walks through the results, trade-offs, and what I learned about embedding API terms of service. The main motivation for using USearch is that CPU compute is cheap and easy to scale.

Translation: I made one model compress a novel into a comic strip, then made another model read the comic strip and still ace QA. It‚Äôs basically passing notes in class, except the note is a 1920√ó1080 meme and the teacher is a transformer. We've gone from "Attention is All You Need" to "Attention is Too Expensive, Just Use Your Eyes." Remember kids: in 2025 literacy is optional, but JPEG is forever.
