But It turns out this video model can also produce great image results with incredible prompt adherence! The image output is sharp, detailed, and sticks to the prompt better than most. üëâ Try it now: ovi054/wan2-2-text-to-image See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:38:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ovi054/792225323579087</guid></item><item><title>OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-OSS has sparked ~400 new models on Hugging Face and racked up 5M downloads in less than a week, already outpacing DeepSeek R1‚Äôs first-week numbers.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/155578033980873</link><description>OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-OSS has sparked ~400 new models on Hugging Face and racked up 5M downloads in less than a week, already outpacing DeepSeek R1‚Äôs first-week numbers. For comparison: when R1 launched, I tracked 550 derivatives (across 8 base models) in a week, with ~3M downloads. GPT-OSS is ahead on adoption and engagement. It‚Äôs also the most-liked release of any major LLM this summer. The 20B and 120B versions quickly shot past Kimi K2, GLM 4.5, and others in likes. Most-downloaded GPT-OSS models include LM Studio and Unsloth AI versions: 1Ô∏è‚É£ openai/gpt-oss-20b - 2.0M 2Ô∏è‚É£ lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-MLX-8bit - 750K 3Ô∏è‚É£ openai/gpt-oss-120b - 430K 4Ô∏è‚É£ unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF - 380K 5Ô∏è‚É£ lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF - 330K The 20B version is clearly finding its audience, showing the power of smaller, faster, more memory- and energy-efficient models.

The goal is to see if we can find universal rules for which layers can be quantized aggressively without impacting performance.The results are fascinating and reveal two key insights: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sensitivity profiles are like architectural "fingerprints." Models from the same family share strikingly similar sensitivity patterns. As you can see in the charts below for the Gemma and SmolLM families, the ranking and relative sensitivity of the layers remain remarkably consistent. This suggests that the underlying architecture is a primary driver of a model's quantization behavior. 2Ô∏è‚É£ A "universal" mixed-precision quantization strategy is challenging. While models within a family are similar, these "fingerprints" change dramatically when comparing different architectures like LLaMA,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:38:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/badaoui/360505768110002</guid></item><item><title>I'm excited to announce that I've just released the newest versions of my Kuvera models and the expanded Personal Finance Reasoning dataset on Hugging Face!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Akhil-Theerthala/336725802829969</link><description>I'm excited to announce that I've just released the newest versions of my Kuvera models and the expanded Personal Finance Reasoning dataset on Hugging Face! What's new: I've expanded the Personal Finance Reasoning Dataset, which now includes 18.9k samples of real-world financial questions paired with detailed, empathetic answers. The previous generation pipeline was also streamlined with better psychological context and response validations. I've also released new Kuvera models trained on this improved dataset: - Kuvera-4B &amp; 8B: These are my upgraded non-reasoning models, fine-tuned to provide practical financial advice. I've specifically trained the 8B model to better understand the user's emotional context. - Kuvera-12B: A first experimental reasoning model focused on the query resolution. As the sole person working on this project, this release is a noticeable step forward from my previous work, offering more powerful and nuanced tools for financial AI.

This dataset provides clear examples of when LLMs should decline requests, such as: - Counting characters (e.g., "number of 'r's in 'raspberry'" ‚Äì seriously, you‚Äôve got this) - Solving basic equations (like *5.9 = x + 5.11* ‚Äì please, show that calculator some love) Inspired by Little Britain's iconic "Computer Says No" sketch, we address a critical issue in AI systems today: the waste of using a rocket launcher to swat flies (aka powerful models for trivial tasks). Goals: - Reduce waste by saving compute for tasks that actually need it - Guide users to better tools - Spark discussion about ethical AI This isn‚Äôt a training set. It‚Äôs a provocation: if we don‚Äôt define AI's limits, who will?
