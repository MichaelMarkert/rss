But what happens when an AI tells you "I understand how you feel" and you actually believe it? At Hugging Face, together with @ frimelle and @ yjernite , we dug into something we felt wasn't getting enough attention: the need to evaluate AI companionship behaviors. These are the subtle ways AI systems validate us, engage with us, and sometimes manipulate our emotional lives. Here's what we found: 👉 Existing benchmarks (accuracy, helpfulness, safety) completely miss this emotional dimension. 👉 We mapped how leading AI systems actually respond to vulnerable prompts. 👉 We built the Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA): a first attempt at evaluating how models handle emotional dependency, boundaries, and attachment (with a full paper coming soon).
