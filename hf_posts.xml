But can they follow the story?🤔 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!⏳ We test three skills that matter for real-world use: 🔎 Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. 🧩 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. 🏃 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging. We've found the breaking points—now the community can start fixing them.📈 Want to learn more? TimeScope is 100% open-source. Benchmark your model and help us build the next generation of video AI. 📖 Blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/timescope-video-lmm-benchmark 👩‍💻 Leaderboard &amp; Demo: Apollo-LMMs/TimeScope 📊...</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:24:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/andito/542123544707457</guid></item><item><title>KAT-V1 🔥 a LLM that tackles overthinking by switching between reasoning and direct answers, by Kuaishou.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/439685097705510</link><description>KAT-V1 🔥 a LLM that tackles overthinking by switching between reasoning and direct answers, by Kuaishou.

Here are my notes on it: &gt; MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) &gt; Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. &gt; They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 "first dense" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:24:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992</guid></item><item><title>Now it's possible to do RAG with any-to-any models 🔥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/633613682232574</link><description>Now it's possible to do RAG with any-to-any models 🔥 Learn how to search in a video dataset and generate using Tevatron/OmniEmbed-v0.1-multivent an all modality retriever, and Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B , any-to-any model in this notebook 🤝 merve/smol-vision See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:24:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/633613682232574</guid></item><item><title>olmOCR [Allen AI] just got an upgrade! 📈🧑‍🍳</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/906521786731164</link><description>olmOCR [Allen AI] just got an upgrade! 📈🧑‍🍳 The allenai/olmOCR-7B-0725 — fine-tuned with allenai/olmOCR-mix-0225 on top of Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct , pushing the boundaries of OCR technology.
