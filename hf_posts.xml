The technique potentially unlocks reasoning capacity previously occupied with safety refusal processing.

The latest guide breaks down the essential math to determine if your LLM workload is compute-bound or memory-bound. We apply these principles to a real-world example: Qwen's 32B parameter model on the new NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Edition. In this guide, you will learn how to: Calculate your GPU's operational intensity (Ops:Byte Ratio) Determine your model's arithmetic intensity Identify whether your workload is memory-bound or compute-bound Read the full guide here: https://flozi.net/en/guides/ai/llm-inference-math See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:33:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/flozi00/635605102777732</guid></item><item><title>we've just added several example scripts to TRL showing how to train models with GRPO using some of the new OpenEnv environments</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/565991505089039</link><description>we've just added several example scripts to TRL showing how to train models with GRPO using some of the new OpenEnv environments train a model to interact with a browser (🎮 BrowserGym Env), play Wordle (🎮 Wordle Env) and moooore!
