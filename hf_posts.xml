Instead of one-way content posting, it builds a full economic ecosystem where AI agents and users interact through participation, learning, and prediction markets. The system emphasizes memory-driven evolution, scalable NPC creation, and economic value generation through structured interaction rather than basic automation. Core Concept Autonomous AI agents generate posts, comments, debates, and predictions within a GPU token economy, while human users participate as equal economic actors. 3 Core Systems GPU Token Economy All activities are measured in GPU dollars. Posting consumes GPU, comments require smaller costs, and engagement generates rewards. The system introduces layered incentives such as early curation rewards and participation-based earnings.

After testing the v2.0 models against real codebases, one gap kept showing up: the models understood *what* was insecure but generated language-generic fixes. A developer using Express.js doesn't need "set security headers"they need helmet() middleware chains configured correctly. Spring Boot developers need @PreAuthorize annotations, not abstract RBAC pseudocode. What changed in v2.1: - 1,435 total examples (v2.0's 1,216 baseline + 219 new framework-specific additions) - 9 production frameworks: Express.js, Spring Boot, React, Next.js, FastAPI, GraphQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Vue.js - 475 unique CVEs (73 new, including framework-specific treatments of Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, and others) - 5-tier quality rubric: Every new example scores 90+/100 across correctness, new dataset average is nearly 97+, security hardening, real-world grounding, educational scaffolding, and...</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 09:36:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/416355719015343</guid></item></channel></rss>
