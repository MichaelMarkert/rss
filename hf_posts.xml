Model now shows step-by-step thinking in &lt;think&gt; tags before answering. Logic puzzle accuracy: 61% → 84%. 3 hours training on single GPU. 🧠 Used GRPO where model generates multiple responses and learns to prefer better reasoning. Works surprisingly well for making smaller models more transparent. 🔗 Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/codelion/ellora/blob/main/Ellora_Recipe_2_Reasoning_LoRA_with_Self-Rewarding_GRPO.ipynb 🤗 Model: codelion/gemma-3-1b-it-reasoning-grpo-lora 💻 Code: https://github.com/codelion/ellora See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 13:31:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/968650774475150</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/809439997973106</link><description>🎉 Fashion Fit 360: The New Standard in AI Virtual Try-On! 🚀 Now Live and Free to Use!Say goodbye to online shopping uncertainty - "Will this look good on me?" - with our revolutionary solution!Fashion Fit 360 is a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual fitting service that transforms your fashion shopping experience.

I have literally shown 26 unique cases and provided demo images and prompts. After watching this tutorial your image editing skills will move to next level i promise you that. Also this tutorial will give you a lot of ideas.
