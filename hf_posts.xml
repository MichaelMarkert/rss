System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. 🚀 How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. 📊 Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% → 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% → 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% → 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. ✨ Key benefits: 🔄 Cumulative learning over time 📖 Transparent, inspectable strategies 🔌 Works with any OpenAI-compatible API ⚡ Simple integration: just add "spl-" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm. After 500 queries, our system developed 129 strategies and refined 97 of them! This feels like a genuine step toward AI that learns...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:36:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200</guid></item><item><title>Hey!

I built RAG MCP Server Space, a simple Gradio MCP server for RAG systems that allows you to search relevant results without passing huge contexts to your LLM. You can use this space to integrate with your agents and improve the efficiency of your search results. Feel free to try it out and let me know if you have any feedback or questions! frascuchon/rag-mcp-server Thanks for checking it out!

App-Use lets you scope agents to just the apps they need. Instead of full desktop access, say "only work with Safari and Notes" or "just control iPhone Mirroring" - visual isolation without new processes for perfectly focused automation. Running computer-use on the entire desktop often causes agent hallucinations and loss of focus when they see irrelevant windows and UI elements. App-Use solves this by creating composited views where agents only see what matters, dramatically improving task completion accuracy What you can build: Research agents working in Safari while writing agents draft in Notes, iPhone automation for messages and reminders, parallel testing across isolated app sessions, or teams of specialized agents working simultaneously without interference. Currently macOS-only (Quartz compositing engine).

In this tutorial video I will show you how to use the most powerful video generation model Wan 2.1 with CausVid LoRA effortlessly. Normally, Wan 2.1 requires 50 steps to get excellent results. With CausiVid LoRA we get such excellent results only in 8 steps. Morever, with newest version 2, now the quality is almost identical to base Wan 2.1. I will show how to download and use in SwarmUI with 1-click to apply download and apply presets. We will also leverage of ComfyUI and fastest attention (Sage Attention). 🔗Follow below link to download the zip file that contains SwarmUI installer and AI models downloader Gradio App - the one used in the tutorial ⤵️ ▶️ https://www.patreon.com/posts/SwarmUI-Installer-AI-Videos-Downloader-114517862 ▶️ CausVid Main Tutorial :...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:36:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/937623008756207</guid></item></channel></rss>
