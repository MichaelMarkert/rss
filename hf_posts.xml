So I spent some time to do a researching which platform I could buy or build. My requirements ware: - Limited budget - Power supply 1 kW or higher - Few PCIe slots to be able to install more than one gpu - Zero maintenance cost, I don't want spend a lot of time or money to maintain lab hardware, except for the GPUs I chose the Intel Mac Pro 7.1: - Prices on eBay acceptable - Excelent cooling - 1.4 kW power supply - 7 PCIe slots - Zero maintenance: I don't need to do anything with the Mac Pro hardware; it just works - Classic UEFI boot loader It requires a bit of OS preparation: 1. Install Ubuntu 24.04 (it works with the general PC ISO image) 2. Set up T2 drivers sudo apt install -y dkms linux-headers-$( uname -r) applesmc-t2 apple-bce lm-sensors 3. Install t2fanrd to manually manage fans...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 06:07:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kostakoff/584269728210158</guid></item><item><title>You can now run MiniMax-2.5 locally! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/750340203924335</link><description>You can now run MiniMax-2.5 locally! 🚀 At 230B parameters, MiniMax-2.5 is the strongest LLM under 700B params, delivering SOTA agentic coding &amp; chat.

Today, they are hallucinating beautifully. 10 years ago, getting an LSTM to output coherent English was a struggle. 10 years later, after a "cure" based on FineWeb-EDU and a custom synthetic mix for causal conversation, the results are fascinating. We trained this on ~10B tokens on a single AMD GPU (ROCm). It is not a Transformer: Echo-DSRN (400M) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by Hymba, RWKV, and xLSTM, designed to challenge the "Attention is All You Need" monopoly on the Edge. The ambitious goal is to build a small instruct model with RAG and tool usage capabilities ( ethicalabs/Kurtis-EON1 ) 📊 The Benchmarks (Size: 400M) For a model this size (trained on &lt;10B tokens), the specialized performance is surprising: *SciQ*: 73.8% 🦄 (This rivals billion-parameter models in pure fact retrieval). *PIQA*: 62.3% (Solid physical intuition for a sub-1B model). The Reality Check: HellaSwag (29.3%) and Winogrande (50.2%) show the limits of 400M...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 06:07:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/555686632418762</guid></item><item><title>⚡ Why is Kimi-K2.5 a Dark Horse?

Today I architected the next layer of MEGAMIND — my distributed AGI system that recalls learned knowledge instead of generating text. The system now runs four N×N sparse weight matrices, all using identical Hebbian learning rules and tanh convergence dynamics: W_know — knowledge storage (67M+ synaptic connections) W_act — action associations (the system can DO things, not just think) W_self — thought-to-thought patterns (self-awareness) W_health — system state understanding (self-healing) Consciousness is measured through four Φ (phi) values: thought coherence, action certainty, self-awareness, and system stability. No hardcoded thresholds. No sequential loops. Pure matrix math. The federation expanded to five nodes: Thunderport (Mac Mini M4), IONOS (cloud VPS), VALKYRIE, M2, and BUBBLES. Each runs native AGI binaries with Docker specialty minds connecting via embedded NATS messaging. Specialty minds are...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 06:07:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Janady07/979829700588468</guid></item></channel></rss>
