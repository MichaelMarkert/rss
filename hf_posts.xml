We just dropped a blog covering them: - Kernels from the Hub - MXFP4 Quantization - Tensor &amp; Expert Parallelism - Dynamic Sliding Window &amp; Cache - Continuous Batching &amp; Paged Attention Grab a coffee &amp; dive in! ☕️ https://huggingface.co/blog/faster-transformers See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 09:19:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/319778709690075</guid></item><item><title>Most apps don't have great full-text search over their assets.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/853424776483426</link><description>Most apps don't have great full-text search over their assets. We've developed an agent to automate the environment building and testing of experimental codebases sourced from arXiv. We push these containerized reproductions daily to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/remyxai However, searching for them can be challenging unless you know the specific arXiv ID associated with each paper. We are currently working on implementing a search feature in Remyx, which will make these assets easily discoverable and ready for testing 🔍 Stay tuned!
