We’ve just released the results from a large-scale human evaluation (400k annotations) of OpenGVLab’s newest text-to-image model, Lumina. Surprisingly, Lumina outperforms OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 in terms of alignment, although it ranks #6 in our overall human preference benchmark. To support further development in text-to-image models, we’re making our entire human-annotated dataset publicly available. If you’re working on model improvements and need high-quality data, feel free to explore. We welcome your feedback and look forward to any insights you might share!

Unlike traditional embedding models that directly match queries with documents, O1 Embedder first generates thoughtful reflections about the query before performing retrieval. This two-step process significantly improves performance on complex retrieval tasks, especially those requiring intensive reasoning or zero-shot generalization to new domains. The technical implementation is fascinating: - The model integrates two essential functions: Thinking and Embedding - It uses an "Exploration-Refinement" data synthesis workflow where initial thoughts are generated by an LLM and refined by a retrieval committee - A multi-task training method fine-tunes a pre-trained...</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:17:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/singhsidhukuldeep/419917039256941</guid></item><item><title>Now the Hugging Face agent course is getting real!

With frameworks like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangChain. 🔗 Follow the org for updates https://huggingface.co/agents-course This week we are releasing the first framework unit in the course and it’s on smolagents. This is what the unit covers: - why should you use smolagents vs another library? - how to build agents that use code - build multiagents systems - use vision language models for browser use The team has been working flat out on this for a few weeks. Led by @ sergiopaniego and supported by smolagents author @ m-ric .

Open source olmOCR just dropped and the results are impressive. Tested the free demo with various documents, including a handwritten Claes Oldenburg letter. The speed is impressive: 3000 tokens/second on your own GPU - that's 1/32 the cost of GPT-4o ($190/million pages). Game-changer for content extraction and digital archives. To achieve this, Ai2 trained a 7B vision language model on 260K pages from 100K PDFs using "document anchoring" - combining PDF metadata with page images. Best part: it actually understands document structure (columns, tables, equations) instead of just jumbling everything together like most OCR tools. Their human eval results back this up. 👉 Try the demo: https://olmocr.allenai.org Going right into the AI toolkit: JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:17:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/636972739498133</guid></item><item><title>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</link><description>Dropping some of the custom fine-tunes based on SigLIP2, with a single-label classification problem type! 🌀🧤 - AI vs Deepfake vs Real : prithivMLmods/AI-vs-Deepfake-vs-Real-Siglip2 - Deepfake Detect : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Detect-Siglip2 - Fire Detection : prithivMLmods/Fire-Detection-Siglip2 - Deepfake Quality Assess : prithivMLmods/Deepfake-Quality-Assess-Siglip2 - Guard Against Unsafe Content : prithivMLmods/Guard-Against-Unsafe-Content-Siglip2 🌠Collection : prithivMLmods/siglip2-custom-67bcdb2de8fe96b99fb4e19e See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:17:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/305640045790864</guid></item><item><title>Quick POC: Turn a Hugging Face dataset card into a short podcast introducing the dataset using all open models.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/855251141208457</link><description>Quick POC: Turn a Hugging Face dataset card into a short podcast introducing the dataset using all open models.
