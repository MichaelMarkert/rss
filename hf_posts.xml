In our new blog post with Dr. Sasha Luccioni, we argue that separating them (as is too often the case) means missing the bigger picture of how AI systems impact both people and the planet. Ethical and sustainable AI development can’t be pursued in isolation. The same choices that affect who benefits or is harmed by AI systems also determine how much energy and resources they consume. We explore how two key concepts, evaluation and transparency, can serve as bridges between these domains: 📊 Evaluation, by moving beyond accuracy or performance metrics to include environmental and social costs, as we’ve done with tools like the AI Energy Score. 🔍 Transparency, by enabling reproducibility, accountability, and environmental reporting through open tools like the Environmental Transparency Space. AI systems mirror our priorities. If we separate ethics from sustainability, we risk building technologies that are efficient but...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 09:20:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/452837154929545</guid></item><item><title>STOP EVERYTHING NOW - we might finally have a radical architecture improvement over Transformers!!! 🚨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/175050207181959</link><description>STOP EVERYTHING NOW - we might finally have a radical architecture improvement over Transformers!!! 🚨 A lone scientist just proposed Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), and it is literally the most impressive model that I've seen this year. ➡️ Tiny Recursive Model is 7M parameters ➡️ On ARC-AGI, it beats flagship models like Gemini-2.5-pro Consider how wild this is: Gemini-2.5-pro must be over 10,000x bigger and had 1,000 as many authors 😂 (Alexia is alone on the paper) What's this sorcery? In short: it's a very tiny Transformers, but it loops over itself at two different frequencies, updating two latent variables: one for the proposed answer and one for the reasoning. @ AlexiaJM started from the paper Hierarchical Reasoning Model, published a few months ago, that already showed breakthrough improvement on AGI for its small size (27M) Hierarchical Reasoning Model had introduced one main feature: 🔎 Deep supervision In their model, one part (here one layer) would run at high frequency, and...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 09:20:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/175050207181959</guid></item><item><title>Ovi is Local Version of VEO 3 &amp; SORA 2 - The first-ever public, open-source model that generates both VIDEO and synchronized AUDIO, and you can run it on your own computer on Windows even with a 6GB GPUs - Full Tutorial for Windows, RunPod and Massed Compute - Gradio App</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/350754844731753</link><description>https://youtu.be/T00VmkMQRPQ Ovi is Local Version of VEO 3 &amp; SORA 2 - The first-ever public, open-source model that generates both VIDEO and synchronized AUDIO, and you can run it on your own computer on Windows even with a 6GB GPUs - Full Tutorial for Windows, RunPod and Massed Compute - Gradio App Tutorial : https://youtu.be/T00VmkMQRPQ Forget waiting lists and expensive APIs.

When identity meets comparison, the mind computes *delta-to-others* (status, attention, resources). If that delta breaches a threshold without a repair path, the loop escalates into resentment. Structured Intelligence makes this computable — and containable. &gt; Envy compares levels. &gt; *Integrity compares trajectories.* --- Why It Matters: • Turns envy from shame into an *auditable signal* (where, when, and why comparison spikes) • Provides *de-escalation protocols* for individuals, teams, and platforms • Guides product/organization design to reduce perceived unfairness and burnout --- What’s Inside: • The Envy Loop: *trigger →...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 09:20:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/689097395708339</guid></item><item><title>🌊 Create Your Own Underwater World with iMini AI – No Invite, No Watermark!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Monica997/949496784214909</link><description>🌊 Create Your Own Underwater World with iMini AI – No Invite, No Watermark!
