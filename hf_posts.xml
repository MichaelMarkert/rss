The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, "Whispered Tuning", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. 🔗 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:54:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</guid></item><item><title>Experimental global target bits‑per‑weight quantization of mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512 and mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/eaddario/695215283251750</link><description>Experimental global target bits‑per‑weight quantization of mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512 and mistralai/Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512 Unlike standard llama.cpp quantizations that rely on fixed type heuristics (e.g., Q4_K_M), the Target BPW approach optimizes per-tensor precision where it matters the most, and produces high quality models that meet a precise global file size target. Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

The goal of this project is to build a decision-support tool for recruiters that doesn’t just “sound confident,” but can actually explain why it produces a given recommendation. Link: 19arjun89/AI_Recruiting_Agent Over the last few iterations, I’ve focused on three areas: 1) Deterministic Verification of Job Requirements (Skills) Previously, required skills were extracted by an LLM from the job description. While this worked well, it still relied heavily on model behavior. I’ve now added a verification layer that: Requires every “required” skill to be backed by a verbatim quote from the job description This means hallucinated skills are explicitly detected and removed before scoring. The system now shows: What the model extracted What was verified What...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:54:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/19arjun89/812902911486628</guid></item><item><title>📢 Who want's to have a quick start for adapting CoT schema for any LLM, this post would be relevant.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/337674723701292</link><description>📢 Who want's to have a quick start for adapting CoT schema for any LLM, this post would be relevant. Excited to share a new version of 🌟 bulk-chain 🌟! Bulk-chain is high-level wrapper over LLM providers for efficient quering LLMs hosted by third-party services. It brings native batching via support of async clients. 🌟 https://github.com/nicolay-r/bulk-chain/tree/master What's new: ☑️ Simplified inference setup The API is now closer to the OpenAI paradigm for toggling streaming. Instead of separate patterns in 1.2.0, now it is possible to simple toggles to enable streaming and async behavior. ☑️ 🛠️ Fixed issues when passing code contain {} blocks ☑️ 🛠️ Async streaming + batching now works properly ☑️ 🛠️ Logging of prompts could be disabled https://github.com/nicolay-r/bulk-chain 🚨 Guys, I am open to work as developer / researcher in AI / NLP / IR in the UK 🇬🇧 🌟 Feel free to support bulk-chain on Github if you like so, or this post. It helps alot!
