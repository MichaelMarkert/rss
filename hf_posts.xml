In my latest article, I provide a step-by-step guide to running regression using Hugging Face, applying it to financial news data to predict stock returns. In this tutorial, you will learn how to: -Prepare and preprocess textual and numerical data for regression -Configure a Transformer model for regression tasks -Apply the model to real-world financial datasets with fully reproducible code Read the full article here: https://huggingface.co/blog/SelmaNajih001/how-to-run-a-regression-using-hugging-face The dataset used: SelmaNajih001/FinancialClassification See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 13:24:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/436109607618945</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ Exciting News!

This PoC tests whether mission identity, ethics, and governance can endure across centuries of generational drift and uncertainty. A starship becomes more than transport: it is a *self-sustaining arc of civilization*. &gt; The challenge is not propulsion. &gt; *It is continuity of mind and mission.* --- Why It Matters: ‚Ä¢ Demonstrates structural continuity over simulated 500-year journeys ‚Ä¢ Validates conflict mediation and governance stability without collapse ‚Ä¢ Proves that ethics and identity can persist across generations --- What‚Äôs Inside: ‚Ä¢ Starship OS integrating resilience, ethics, and memory loops ‚Ä¢ Simulation of generational conflict, scarcity events, value...</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 13:24:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/107464223968156</guid></item><item><title>ü•ä  Big Code Arena is live!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZennyKenny/911264518414164</link><description>ü•ä Big Code Arena is live! bigcode/arena üí° bigcode is an open scientific collaboration working on responsible training of large language models for coding applications. üëâ The Arena ranks LLMs based on their ability to support natural language vibe coding requests in a competitive format, based on feedback from human reviewers. üß† It was a pleasure to contribute to this project led by @ terryyz and appear as an additional contributor in the Big Code Arena paper.
