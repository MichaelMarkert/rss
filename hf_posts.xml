Diffusers just added support for another caching method: First Block Cache - a technique developed by @ chengzeyi building upon the ideas of TeaCache. The idea in short is: if the model predictions do not vary much over successive inference steps, we can skip certain steps where the prediction difference is small. To figure out whether an inference step will make a significant improvement to the overall velocity/noise prediction, we calculate the relative difference of the output of the first transformer block at timestep $t$ with $t-1$, and compare it against a selected threshold. If the difference is lower than the threshold, we skip the step. A higher threshold will lead to more steps being skipped. However, skipping many steps is bad because it can throw off the model predictions, and so we need to test and select the threshold based on level of quality-speed tradeoff...</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:23:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/a-r-r-o-w/278025275110164</guid></item><item><title>YAML engineering becomes more and more important than ever from infra provisioning to model training (recipes).</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/chansung/585764915046887</link><description>YAML engineering becomes more and more important than ever from infra provisioning to model training (recipes). Here, I built a simple editor first for @ dstackai , and I will share the live endpoint this week. Let me know what you think about this approach. Based on this approach, if people think this is useful, I am going to do the same thing for the LLM training recipes for popular frameworks such as Hugging Face open-r1, Axolotl, and so on. Let me hear.

Inception Labs was founded a few months ago, and they're not sleeping: after dropping a code model, they just published Mercury chat, a diffusion-based chat model that reaches 1000 tokens / second on H100, i.e. 10x more than models of equivalent performance on the same hardware! What's the breakthrough? Well instead, of generating tokens left-to-right like the more common autoregressive LLMs, diffusion models generate their blocks of text all at once, and successive steps refine the whole text. Diffusion models being really fast at isn't new, we have had some promising results on this by Google already back in May with Gemini Diffusion, and Mercury themselves had already published their coding model a few months ago But being that good quality is new - and now Inception Labs just proved that their models work well in chat...</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:23:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/129069007859083</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ For those who interested in summarization of the long textual reports in medical domain  üìùü©∫,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/221275408085007</link><description>üöÄ For those who interested in summarization of the long textual reports in medical domain üìùü©∫, @ Xiaolihai and I delighted to share that we experiment with distillation tuning adaptation for Qwen-2.5 0.5B. We use reports from the MultiClinSum dataset and pass it through 72B version to retrieve report explanations in order to initiate ditillation tuning for 0.5B model. We experiment with passages written in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. üîë We find that using distil-technique results in 2-4% performance increment on fine-tuning and similar improvements for reports in English (non-official and official evaluation). For the other it results in systems that perform similar to the convential tuning (standard) (see result below).

Think of a simplified, from-scratch version of the Claude Code agent üíª. You can check out the basic framework I've already started here: [github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent]( https://github.com/YerbaPage/Terminal-Agent ) üî• To be clear, the goal isn't to create a perfect, commercial-grade tool. This is a for-fun project geared towards research and exploration. The main idea is to build a **flexible and minimal framework** that helps us understand the modules and functionalities of sophisticated agents like Claude Code. It's a playground to explore how we can enable agents to handle more complex tasks effectively. I'm looking for a few people who'd be interested in exploring this together. We could experiment with ideas like adding a to-do list manager to improve planning or finding better ways for the agent to manage its memory like some...</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:23:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/620116280773759</guid></item><item><title>33 followers AGAIN in another day is insane....
