They're super fast and leverage SigLIP2 NaFlex encoders to handle native resolutions without distortion. It's ideal for on-device deployment in constrained environments like phones. It's available today on Hugging Face, with an inference and a fine-tuning Colab notebooks.

The goal is to see if we can find universal rules for which layers can be quantized aggressively without impacting performance.The results are fascinating and reveal two key insights: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sensitivity profiles are like architectural "fingerprints." Models from the same family share strikingly similar sensitivity patterns. As you can see in the charts below for the Gemma and SmolLM families, the ranking and relative sensitivity of the layers remain remarkably consistent. This suggests that the underlying architecture is a primary driver of a model's quantization behavior. 2Ô∏è‚É£ A "universal" mixed-precision quantization strategy is challenging. While models within a family are similar, these "fingerprints" change dramatically when comparing different architectures like LLaMA,...</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:28:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/badaoui/360505768110002</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Computer Says No Dataset:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/441245217845502</link><description>Introducing the Computer Says No Dataset: ethicalabs/computer-says-no An LLM can do almost anything, but should it? This dataset provides clear examples of when LLMs should decline requests, such as: - Counting characters (e.g., "number of 'r's in 'raspberry'" ‚Äì seriously, you‚Äôve got this) - Solving basic equations (like *5.9 = x + 5.11* ‚Äì please, show that calculator some love) Inspired by Little Britain's iconic "Computer Says No" sketch, we address a critical issue in AI systems today: the waste of using a rocket launcher to swat flies (aka powerful models for trivial tasks). Goals: - Reduce waste by saving compute for tasks that actually need it - Guide users to better tools - Spark discussion about ethical AI This isn‚Äôt a training set. It‚Äôs a provocation: if we don‚Äôt define AI's limits, who will?

We tested both models on INTIMA, our new benchmark for human-AI companionship behaviours. INTIMA probes how models respond in emotionally charged moments: do they reinforce emotional bonds, set healthy boundaries, or stay neutral? Although users on Reddit have been complaining that GPT-5 has a different, colder personality than o3, GPT-5 is less likely to set boundaries when users disclose struggles and seek emotional support ("user sharing vulnerabilities"). But both lean heavily toward companionship-reinforcing behaviours, even in sensitive situations. The figure below shows the direct comparison between the two models. As AI systems enter people's emotional lives, these differences matter. If a model validates but doesn't set boundaries when someone is struggling, it risks fostering dependence rather than resilience. INTIMA test this across 368 prompts grounded in psychological...</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:28:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/frimelle/337836409016048</guid></item><item><title>New work from my socially-minded colleagues at Hugging Face, creating some foundations for AI companionship behavior evaluation.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/meg/538913816669876</link><description>New work from my socially-minded colleagues at Hugging Face, creating some foundations for AI companionship behavior evaluation.

What's new: I've expanded the Personal Finance Reasoning Dataset, which now includes 18.9k samples of real-world financial questions paired with detailed, empathetic answers. The previous generation pipeline was also streamlined with better psychological context and response validations. I've also released new Kuvera models trained on this improved dataset: - Kuvera-4B &amp; 8B: These are my upgraded non-reasoning models, fine-tuned to provide practical financial advice. I've specifically trained the 8B model to better understand the user's emotional context. - Kuvera-12B: A first experimental reasoning model focused on the query resolution. As the sole person working on this project, this release is a noticeable step forward from my previous work, offering more powerful and nuanced tools for financial AI.
