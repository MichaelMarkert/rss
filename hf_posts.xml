We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!

MalayLM is also attractive for organizations wishing to preserve data privacy as it s efficiency allows it to run on a local machine. 🧠 MamayLM is trained on high-quality Ukrainian data and understands Ukrainian language, culture, and history. It is built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 9B model, but uses a number of new advances stemming from INSAIT’s experience in creating BgGPT, a Bulgarian LLM we released last year, now adopted nationwide and profiled several times by Google as a worldwide success case. 🤝 MamayLM is developed in a...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hannayukhymenko/367157502110648</guid></item><item><title>New launch: See the energy use of chatbot conversations, in real time. =)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/meg/994494979628937</link><description>New launch: See the energy use of chatbot conversations, in real time. =) jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Great work from @ JulienDelavande !

Today it becomes more agentic and smarter at navigating complex structures like hypergraphs. Here are 11 latest RAG types: 1. InstructRAG -&gt; InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032) Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization 2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -&gt; CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883) A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store 3. ReaRAG -&gt; ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729) It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/836565977783893</guid></item><item><title>🔥 Announcing FLUX-Juiced: The Fastest Image Generation Endpoint (2.6x faster)!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davidberenstein1957/168311357050100</link><description>🔥 Announcing FLUX-Juiced: The Fastest Image Generation Endpoint (2.6x faster)! Optimisations are widely applied and can reduce inference time, but their impact on quality often remains unclear, so we decided to challenge the status quo and create our own optimised version of FLUX.1[dev] called FLUX-juiced.
