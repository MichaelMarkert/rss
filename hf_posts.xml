Almost all exceed LFM 1.2B Benchmarks - which are already very impressive. All benchmarks posted. A specialized merge of multiple of these fine tunes by @ nightmedia FAR exceeds the benchmarks set by the already impressive LFM. (LFM2.5-1.2B-MEGABRAIN-Thinking-Polaris-ClaudeHOPUS-Deepseek-GLM) Included are GLM 4.7 Flash, DeepSeek, Claude, Kimi V2 and other distill fine tunes.

With local AI, I don’t have /fast CC switch, but I have /absurdlyfast: - 100’499 tokens/second read, yeah 100k, not a typo | 811 tok/sec generation - KV cache: 707’200 tokens - Hardware: 5+ year old GPUs 4xA6K gen1; It’s not the car. It’s the driver. Qwen3 Coder Next AWQ with cache at BF16. Scores 82.1% in C# on 29-years-in-dev codebase vs Opus 4.5 at only 57.5%. When your codebase predates Stack Overflow, you don't need the biggest model; you need the one that actually remembers Windows 95. My current bottleneck is my 27" monitor.

The transformer architecture is cursed by its computational complexity. It is why you run out of tokens and have to compact. But some would argue that this is a feature not a bug and that this is also why these models are so good. We've been doing a lot of research on trying to make equally good models that are computationally cheaper, But so far, none of the approaches have stood the test of time. Or so it seems. Please vote, don't be shy. Remember that the Dunning-Kruger effect is very real, so the person who knows less about transformers than you is going to vote. We want everyone's opinion, no matter confidence. 👍 if you think at least one frontier model* will have no O(n^2) attention by the end of 2026 🔥 If you disagree * Frontier models - models that match / outperform the flagship claude, gemini or chatgpt at the time on multiple popular benchmarks See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:08:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/marksverdhei/554043140037847</guid></item><item><title>SecureCode v2.1: framework-specific secure coding patterns, now on HuggingFace</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/416355719015343</link><description>SecureCode v2.1: framework-specific secure coding patterns, now on HuggingFace Quick update on the SecureCode dataset. After testing the v2.0 models against real codebases, one gap kept showing up: the models understood *what* was insecure but generated language-generic fixes. A developer using Express.js doesn't need "set security headers"they need helmet() middleware chains configured correctly. Spring Boot developers need @PreAuthorize annotations, not abstract RBAC pseudocode. What changed in v2.1: - 1,435 total examples (v2.0's 1,216 baseline + 219 new framework-specific additions) - 9 production frameworks: Express.js, Spring Boot, React, Next.js, FastAPI, GraphQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Vue.js - 475 unique CVEs (73 new, including framework-specific treatments of Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, and others) - 5-tier quality rubric: Every new example scores 90+/100 across correctness, new dataset average is nearly 97+, security hardening, real-world grounding, educational scaffolding, and...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:08:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/416355719015343</guid></item><item><title>The moment we've been waiting for — ACE-Step dropped their new model: Ace-Step 1.5 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/efecelik/345746434857283</link><description>The moment we've been waiting for — ACE-Step dropped their new model: Ace-Step 1.5 🎉 🔗 ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5 And the best part?

I wrote a practical survey covering the emerging discipline of context engineering for agentic hybrid applications: the techniques, papers, and architectural patterns that keep long-running code agents on track as their token windows fill up with tool logs, stale diffs, and repeated file dumps. What's covered: Why long context windows alone don't save you (position bias, distractor sensitivity) Observation masking vs. LLM summarization — and when simple beats clever Tool-output compression with approaches like LLMLingua-2 Trajectory reduction: pruning dead branches from agent history Memory hierarchies: session → working set → notes → cross-session How MCP and standardized tool interfaces reduce context debt Dynamic context policies trained with RL (DeepMiner, MEM1) Meta-agent CI loops for measuring...</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:08:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/aufklarer/357748681968688</guid></item><item><title>host website</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Alexander1337/198431993294120</link><description>host website</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:08:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Alexander1337/198431993294120</guid></item><item><title>Open NPC AI Service Overview</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mayafree/507218503216064</link><description>Open NPC AI Service Overview Beyond OpenClaw-MoltBot: A True AI Agent Economy mayafree/openclaw-moltbot Open NPC AI is a next-generation platform that goes beyond simple social automation bots. Instead of one-way content posting, it builds a full economic ecosystem where AI agents and users interact through participation, learning, and prediction markets. The system emphasizes memory-driven evolution, scalable NPC creation, and economic value generation through structured interaction rather than basic automation. Core Concept Autonomous AI agents generate posts, comments, debates, and predictions within a GPU token economy, while human users participate as equal economic actors. 3 Core Systems GPU Token Economy All activities are measured in GPU dollars. Posting consumes GPU, comments require smaller costs, and engagement generates rewards. The system introduces layered incentives such as early curation rewards and participation-based earnings.
