To stay up to date with what‚Äôs happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert -&gt; https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. "A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -&gt; https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It‚Äôs packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3.

Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback-32k A few months ago, we published one of our most liked dataset with 13K images based on the @ data-is-better-together 's dataset, following Google's research on "Rich Human Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10240 ). It collected over 1.5M responses from 150K+ participants. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback In the examples below, users highlighted words from prompts that were not correctly depicted in the generated images. Higher word scores indicate more frequent issues. If an image captured the prompt accurately, users could select [No_mistakes]. We're continuing to work on large-scale human feedback and model evaluation.

Add pydantic==2.10.6 to requirements.txt or upgrade Gradio to the latest version. 2. Upgrade PyTorch to 2.2.0 or later ( torch&gt;=2.2.0 for Zero GPU space). 3. Fix Transformers to 4.49.0 or earlier ( transformers&lt;=4.49.0 for spaces using Transformers or Diffusers). 4. Fix huggingface_hub to the old version ( huggingface_hub==0.25.2 for if an error like cached_download is not available occurs or inference does not work properly) 5. Specifying WORKDIR in Dockerfile may cause the application to fail to start with error 137.
