So we thought it would be cool to share our favourite icons of the community with a fun award. Winners get free Hugging Face Pro Subscriptions, Merchandise, or compute credits for the hub. üîó Follow and nominate here: community-spotlight This is a new initiative to recognise and celebrate the incredible work being done by community members. It's all about inspiring more collaboration and innovation in the world of machine learning and AI. They're highlighting contributors in four key areas: - model creators: building and sharing innovative and state-of-the-art models. - educators: sharing knowledge through posts, articles, demos, and events. - tool builders: creating the libraries, frameworks, and applications that we all use. - community champions: supporting and mentoring others in forums.

Training on this data dramatically improves the ability to execute code and analyze data. We ( @ baptistecolle @ hannayukhymenko @ lvwerra ) have created a novel synthetic data generation pipeline with efficient scaffolding, which gives a big performance boost after training your coding agentüî•With the help of real Kaggle notebooks and datasets we generate synthetic notebooks which aim to analyze datasets and answer factual questions about them more efficiently. We simulate a real code execution environment by prompting LLMs or with the help of E2B sandboxes. We have built a dataset of 50k+ high-quality LLM-generated notebooks which can help your agent become better at performing data analysis and question answering.
