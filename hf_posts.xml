What makes it special? At Hawky.ai we are started experimenting with Qwen3 recently for Analysis and Optimization. Unlike traditional tools that look at text, images, or audio separately, Qwen3-Omni analyzes everything together. It handles 119 languages, processes 40-minute audio sequences, and understands both images and videos‚Äîall at once. The cool part? It's 2-3x faster than similar models thanks to its MoE architecture. Real applications I'm seeing: Ad Analysis: It scores video ads by combining visual elements, audio tone, and text‚Äîgiving 25% better CTR predictions than single-mode tools. Campaign Localization: Drop in one ad, get 10 localized versions with native voiceovers in under a minute. Perfect for testing across markets. Market Research: Feed it competitor content, podcasts, or UGC videos. It extracts actionable...</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 05:21:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Sri-Vigneshwar-DJ/891594547382960</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ Big news from XenArcAI!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/228189451590505</link><description>üöÄ Big news from XenArcAI!

This tension is especially visible in conversational systems, where safeguards can sometimes feel more paternalistic than supportive. In my latest piece for Hugging Face, I argue that open source and community-driven approaches offer a promising (though not exclusive) way forward. ‚ú® Transparency can make safety mechanisms into learning opportunities. ‚ú® Collaboration with diverse communities makes safeguards more relevant across contexts. ‚ú® Iteration in the open lets protections evolve rather than freeze into rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Of course, this isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. Top-down safety measures will still be necessary in some cases. But if we only rely on corporate control, we risk building systems that are safe at the expense of trust and autonomy.

Probably, you have done it with minimising a KL divergence, and it somehow worked. Well, not that well, right? 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your model tends to memorise! 2Ô∏è‚É£ Your model might get the right answer, but its reasoning might be flawed. To fix those problems, we rethink distillation and process a new approach! A method that is based on constrained RL that comes with nice theoretical guarantees and excellent performance!

I've managed to gather a fairly large dataset of .pdfs of varying quality. I have about 10gb total. I want to use it to fine tune a model and/or a RAG system. I've been having a terrible time trying to get the data prepared so I can train with it. I've tried google collab, I've tried Kaggle and paid for GPUs on both, but I'm struggling. This is because I'm not a data scientist and have zero background in programming, etc. I'm just using AI to teach me along the way.  I'm willing to pay some money for GPU power, but because I fail so frequently I fear I'm just burning through it. I don't have enough horsepower on my laptop - I've tried to train on it, but to no avail. I've had minor successes, but have not been able to complete the dataset with anything comprehensible. Any and all suggestions are welcome. I need some serious help. Thanks!!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Znilsson/836359160713115</link><description>Hi there, I'm an amateur AI enthusiast.
