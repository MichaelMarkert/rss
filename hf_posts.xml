For papers that include code, setting up the right environment often means hours of dependency hell and configuration debugging. At Remyx AI, we built an agent that automatically creates and tests Docker images for research papers, then shares them publicly so anyone can reproduce results with a single command. We just submitted PR #908 to integrate this directly into arXiv Labs. If you believe in making reproducible research accessible to everyone, give it a bump!: https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-browse/pull/908 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 13:30:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/494327094243098</guid></item><item><title>Just released a preview of Moondream 3!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/vikhyatk/428307575853218</link><description>Just released a preview of Moondream 3! moondream/moondream3-preview This is a 9B parameter, 2B active MoE VLM with state of the art visual reasoning capabilities.

I uploaded a single photo of my corgi, and within minutes, it generated a detailed 3D figurine model. What makes this really interesting for tech and design folks: AI-powered 2D ‚Üí 3D conversion (no manual modeling required) Preserves character consistency even with multiple images Export options for 3D printing or digital use (OBJ, FBX, STL) Works with pets, people, and even illustrated characters For anyone into 3D modeling, collectibles, or architecture visualization, this is a game-changer. Imagine transforming static photos into tangible 3D assets with just a few clicks. Here‚Äôs the link if you want to try it out: https://imini.com/nano-banana Has anyone else here tested Nano Banana for pets or other personal projects? Would love to hear your results!
