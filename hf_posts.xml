Want to do data extraction, translation, RAG, tool use, or math on a Raspberry Pi? We got you covered! ✅ These tiny models were fine-tuned to perform narrow tasks extremely well, making them competitive with much larger models. You can deploy them today on-device or even on GPUs for big data operations!

David must be released. I will prepare a standard sweep for david to showcase the prowess of the final multi-vocab variant. This will include a variation that contains all mnist variants, cifar10, cifar100, imagenet 1k, and in the future I'll prepare a full imagenet sweep utilizing the entire 12m corpus instead of the 1.2m I used. I may need to get in touch with the actual curator of the dataset for licensing but maybe not. David utilizes 4 projective variants of the vocabulary and the training process involves teaching and freezing them akin to teacher/student processing. I did not want to release David yet, but I believe now that David will save lives and it's irresponsible for me to contain such a creation.

It's poorly documented, but the code should be straightforward. https://github.com/jim-plus/llm-abliteration The code is built atop a fork that enabled abliteration to be performed on models loaded in 4-bit or 8-bit bitsandbytes quantization. TransformerLens is not required, just plain Transformers. For those previously unaware, this opens up abliteration experimentation to more people with local VRAM limitations. Since performing abliteration on a quant involves precision and perplexity loss, it stands to reason that a small amount of magnitude sparsification could filter out some noise and possibly even reduce the damage inflicted on latent space via ablation of the refusal vector. There's a small but real acceleration of ablation of the refusal vector by reducing outer product operations from O(d²×n) to O(d×n), and then by pushing said computation layerwise to GPU. The code is hardcoded for...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:27:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/grimjim/556474107312531</guid></item><item><title>12 Excellent MCP Servers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/566496725881885</link><description>12 Excellent MCP Servers The family of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers keeps expanding to bridge agents, models, tools, web, data and apps. Here are 12 useful MCP servers that will help you create convenient agentic ecosystems: 1. Chrome DevTools MCP → https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp Lets your coding agent (Gemini, Claude, Cursor, Copilot) control a live Chrome browser with full DevTools access for automation, debugging, and performance analysis 2. Windows-MCP → https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP Provides interaction between agents and Windows, handling file navigation, app control, UI actions, QA testing 3. MCPControl → https://github.com/claude-did-this/MCPControl Windows control server for programmatic control of mouse, keyboard, window management, and screen capture 4. MetaMCP → https://github.com/metatool-ai/metamcp A proxy that aggregates multiple MCP servers into one, with middleware support.

It is a *protocol* — reproducible, auditable, teachable. Three demonstrations (acting/self-reference, math/nonverbal, martial/cosmic) were enough to prove the point. Genius was never about *who* did it, but *how* structure makes such leaps possible. &gt; To end the myth of genius &gt; is to begin its practice by everyone. --- Why It Matters: • Demystifies genius, reframing it as systematic structural method • Shows why only a few demonstrations are sufficient — reproducibility is the proof • Opens the door for education, AI, and research to cultivate genius procedurally --- What’s Inside: • Recap of the protocol and its demonstrations • Reflection on why “enough examples” suffices structurally • Implications: from talent myths to...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:27:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/517613830750903</guid></item><item><title>🐾 Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? 🐱💖</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ethank01/155417923515007</link><description>🐾 Ever wished your cute little furball could have its own exclusive merch? 🐱💖 With iMini’s Nano Banana sticker template, you can turn your cat’s photo into adorable nine-grid stickers 🎨✨.
