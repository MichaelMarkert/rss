I noticed that model cards usually have Transformers code as usage examples. So I tried to figure out how to load a model just using the transformers library without using ollama, lmstudio, or llamacpp. Learned how to install dependencies required to make it work like pytorch and CUDA. I also used Conda for python environment dependencies. Once I got the model loaded and sample inference working, I made an API to serve it. I know it's very basic stuff for machine learning experts here in HF but I'm completely new to this so I'm happy to get it working! Model used: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Here's the result of my experimentation See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:30:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/melvindave/358781763788308</guid></item><item><title>ICYMI, you can fine-tune open LLMs using Claude Code</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/384415208092213</link><description>ICYMI, you can fine-tune open LLMs using Claude Code just tell it: “Fine-tune Qwen3-0.6B on open-r1/codeforces-cots” and Claude submits a real training job on HF GPUs using TRL. it handles everything: &gt; dataset validation &gt; GPU selection &gt; training + Trackio monitoring &gt; job submission + cost estimation when it’s done, your model is on the Hub, ready to use read more about the process: https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-skills-training See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:30:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/384415208092213</guid></item><item><title>We just released TRL v0.26.0!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/627155943228357</link><description>We just released TRL v0.26.0!

It introduces multi-processing for CrossEncoder (rerankers), multilingual NanoBEIR evaluators, similarity score outputs in mine_hard_negatives, Transformers v5 support and more. Details: - CrossEncoder multi-processing: Similar to SentenceTransformer and SparseEncoder, you can now use multi-processing with CrossEncoder rerankers. Useful for multi-GPU and CPU settings, and simple to configure: just device=["cuda:0", "cuda:1"] or device=["cpu"]*4 on the model.predict or model.rank calls. - Multilingual NanoBEIR Support: You can now use community translations of the tiny NanoBEIR retrieval benchmark instead of only the English one, by passing dataset_id , e.g. dataset_id="lightonai/NanoBEIR-de" for the German benchmark. - Similarity scores in Hard Negatives Mining: When mining for hard negatives to create a strong training dataset, you can now pass output_scores=True to get similarity scores returned. This can be useful for some...</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:30:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/853653818134091</guid></item><item><title>installama.sh at the TigerBeetle 1000x World Tour !</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/angt/186034800220690</link><description>installama.sh at the TigerBeetle 1000x World Tour ! Last week I had the chance to give a short talk during the TigerBeetle 1000x World Tour (organized by @ jedisct1 👏 ) a fantastic event celebrating high-performance engineering and the people who love pushing systems to their limits! In the talk, I focused on the CPU and Linux side of things, with a simple goal in mind: making the installation of llama.cpp instant, automatic, and optimal, no matter your OS or hardware setup. For the curious, here are the links worth checking out: Event page: https://tigerbeetle.com/event/1000x GitHub repo: https://github.com/angt/installama.sh Talk: https://youtu.be/pg5NOeJZf0o?si=9Dkcfi2TqjnT_30e More improvements are coming soon.
