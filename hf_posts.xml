And yes, those matter immensely. But here's what nobody tells you: when your training run fails at 2 AM because of mysterious 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫𝐬, or when your expensive GPU cluster is running at 𝟔𝟎% 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, the problem isn't your model. It's most probably a 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞. 🛠️ Questions that seemed simple but had no clear answers: Why is 𝐌𝐨𝐄 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬? Which 𝐍𝐂𝐂𝐋 𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐬 should we actually set? How often should we checkpoint without killing throughput? That's why we built 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 📖: a complete guide covering everything from model architecture and data curation to the SmolLM3 training marathon, post-training techniques, and crucially, the 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 that most teams get wrong.

According to the datasheet: - Rated speed: 0.133 s per 60° Calculation: - 0.133 s × 6 = 0.798 s per full rotation - 1 / 0.798 = 1.253 revolutions per second - 1.253 × 60 = 75.2 RPM This confirms the official specification of approximately 75 RPM at 12 V under no load. Our measurement: - Encoder output: 5,300 values per second - Encoder resolution: 4,096 counts per revolution Calculation: - Revolutions per second = 5,300 ÷ 4,096 = 1.294 rev/s - RPM = 1.294 × 60 = 77.6 RPM Result: The measured value differs by only about 2–3% from the datasheet specification, confirming that the STS3250 performs very close to its rated no-load speed. This close agreement validates both the servo’s performance and our measurement approach.
