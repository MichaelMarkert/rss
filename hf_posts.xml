We run daily CI on AMD MI325 to track the health of the most important model architectures and we’ve just made our internal dashboard public. By making this easily accessible, we hope to spark community contributions and improve support for everyone!

We are excited to introduce the first achievement of the Darwin Project. We have evolved an embryonic model that simultaneously inherits the strengths of both non-reasoning models and reasoning models based on Qwen3-4B, creating a new offspring model. openfree/Darwin-Qwen3-4B ✅ Benchmarking results confirm that the traits and advantages of both parent models are fully reflected. ✅ We are releasing Darwin-Qwen3-4B on Hugging Face. 🔬 Technical Specifications Model Configuration -Base Architecture: Qwen3-4B -Parent Model 1: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 -Parent Model 2: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 -Merge Algorithm: Darwin A2AP Enhanced v3.2 -Optimization Method: Evolutionary Algorithm with Adaptive Fitness Evolution Process -Population Size: 20 individuals -Evolution Cycles: 5,000+ generations -Fitness Objectives: Multi-objective optimization (accuracy, robustness, generalization) -Validation Metric: 88.56% on proxy task (digit classification) 📊 Technical...</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 17:16:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/257915517364698</guid></item></channel></rss>
