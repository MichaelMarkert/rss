Models: Qwen/qwen3-67dd247413f0e2e4f653967f Blog: https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/ Demo: Qwen/Qwen3-Demo GitHub: https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3 ✅ Pre-trained 119 languages(36 trillion tokens) and dialects with strong translation and instruction following abilities. (Qwen2.5 was pre-trained on 18 trillion tokens.) ✅Qwen3 dense models match the performance of larger Qwen2.5 models. For example, Qwen3-1.7B/4B/8B/14B/32B perform like Qwen2.5-3B/7B/14B/32B/72B. ✅ Three stage done while pretraining: • Stage 1: General language learning and knowledge building. • Stage 2: Reasoning boost with STEM, coding, and logic skills. • Stage 3: Long context training ✅ It supports MCP in the model ✅ Strong agent skills ✅ Supports seamless between thinking mode (for hard tasks like math and coding) and non-thinking mode (for fast chatting) inside chat...</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merterbak/337137510653930</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the ONNX model explorer: Browse, search, and visualize neural networks directly in your browser. 🤯 A great tool for anyone studying Machine Learning!

To stay up to date with what’s happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert -&gt; https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. "A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -&gt; https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It’s packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3.

I am fascinated by models learning from prompts and rewards - no example answers needed like in Supervised Fine-Tuning. After the DeepSeek boom, everyone is trying GRPO with GSM8K or the Countdown Game... I wanted a different challenge, like 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀. Choosing an original problem forced me to: 🤔 Think about the problem setting 🧬 Generate data 🤏 Choose the right base model 🏆 Design reward functions (and experiencing reward hacking) 🔄 Run multiple rounds of training, hoping that my model would learn something. A fun and rewarding 😄 experience. I learned a lot of things, that I want to share with you. 👇 ✍️ Blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 💻 Code: https://github.com/anakin87/qwen-scheduler-grpo 🤗 Hugging Face collection...</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/692858936883406</guid></item><item><title>Kimi-Audio 🚀🎧 an OPEN audio foundation model released by Moonshot AI</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/658134534684379</link><description>Kimi-Audio 🚀🎧 an OPEN audio foundation model released by Moonshot AI moonshotai/Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct ✨ 7B ✨ 13M+ hours of pretraining data ✨ Novel hybrid input architecture ✨ Universal audio capabilities (ASR, AQA, AAC, SER, SEC/ASC, end-to-end conversation) See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/658134534684379</guid></item><item><title># ✨ Dream of IKEA: The Future of AI Interior Design ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/433098376713304</link><description># ✨ Dream of IKEA: The Future of AI Interior Design ✨ Hello, AI interior design enthusiasts! 🏠 Today I'm thrilled to introduce you to **"Dream of IKEA"** - an amazing project that will completely transform your living spaces! ## 🌟 What Can It Do? **Dream of IKEA** is a magical tool that uses artificial intelligence to transform your ordinary spaces into the interior design of your dreams! 🪄 - 📸 Simply upload a photo of your room - 💭 Describe your desired style or concept - 🎨 The AI will redesign your space with stunning results! ## 🏆 Key Features - **Diverse Style Selection** - Over 20 design styles including Minimalist, Bohemian, Japanese, Scandinavian, and more - **User-Friendly Interface** - Beautiful, intuitive UI that anyone can use - **High-Quality Image Generation** - Amazing quality powered by ControlNet and Stable Diffusion - **Customizable Prompts** - Create completely personalized designs with your own prompts ## 🛠️ Technical Highlights This project utilizes cutting-edge...</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/433098376713304</guid></item><item><title>Finally my first solo preprint is here:) a love letter to the field.
