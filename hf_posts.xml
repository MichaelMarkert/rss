These models achieve 93% average accuracy across enterprise use cases like email routing, fraud detection, document classification, and support ticket categorization. Built on ModernBERT with prototype memory and elastic weight consolidation. Key benefits: 90% cost reduction vs API solutions, 90-120ms local inference, dynamic class addition, and zero vendor lock-in. All models available under adaptive-classifier organization. Install with pip install adaptive-classifier.

I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA and 4-bit quantisation‚Äîon just ~720 hand-picked sarcastic prompt‚Äìresponse pairs from Reddit, Twitter, and real-life conversations. The challenge? Keeping it sarcastic but still helpful. LoRA rank 16 to avoid overfitting 4-bit NF4 quantization to fit on limited GPU memory 10 carefully monitored epochs so it didn‚Äôt turn into a full-time comedian Result: a model that understands ‚ÄúOh great, another meeting‚Äù exactly as you mean it.
