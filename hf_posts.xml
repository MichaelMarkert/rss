This book presents alternatives that rely on explainable AI, featuring new algorithms based on radically different technology with trustworthy, auditable, fast, accurate, secure, replicable Enterprise AI. Most of the material is proprietary and made from scratch, showcasing the culmination of decades of research away from standard models to establish a new framework in machine learning and AI technology. I discuss an efficient DNN architecture based on a new type of universal functions in chapter 4, with DNN distillation and protection via watermarking in chapter 5. Then, in chapter 6, I discuss non-DNN alternatives that yield exact interpolation on the training...</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:43:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/731522720644742</guid></item><item><title>🎉 OpenMed 2025 Year in Review: 6 Months of Open Medical AI</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MaziyarPanahi/255552518498714</link><description>🎉 OpenMed 2025 Year in Review: 6 Months of Open Medical AI I'm thrilled to share what the OpenMed community has accomplished since our July 2025 launch! 📊 The Numbers 29,700,000 downloads Thank you! 🙏 - 481 total models (475 medical NER models + 6 fine-tuned LLMs) - 475 medical NER models in [OpenMed]( OpenMed ) organization - 6 fine-tuned LLMs in [openmed-community]( openmed-community ) - 551,800 PyPI downloads of the [openmed package]( https://pypi.org/project/openmed/ ) - 707 followers on HuggingFace (you!) - 97 GitHub stars on the [toolkit repo]( https://github.com/maziyarpanahi/openmed ) 🏆 Top Models by Downloads 1.

That's why we're highlighting the Priv-IQ benchmark, a new, solution-oriented framework for evaluating LLMs on eight key privacy competencies, from visual privacy to knowledge of privacy law. The direct connection to our work is clear: the researchers relied on samples from the Ai4Privacy dataset to build out questions for Privacy Risk Assessment and Multilingual Entity Recognition. This is the power of open-source collaboration. We provide the data building blocks, and researchers construct powerful new evaluation tools on top of them. It's a win-win for the entire ecosystem when we can all benefit from transparent, data-driven benchmarks that help push for better, safer AI. Kudos to Sakib Shahriar and Rozita A.

We send a prompt, get a "meh" answer, and then spend twenty minutes fixing it ourselves. That’s not a workflow; that’s just a digital chore. I wanted to see if I could push Claude further—to see if I could build a system that actually learns and refines itself. That’s how the Claude-Reflect-System (Skill Reflect) was born. But here’s the thing: this isn’t some polished, final product. It’s a concept. It’s a blueprint. I’ve built the foundation of a recursive reflection loop that forces the AI to step back, look at its work, and act as its own harshest critic. It identifies the "skill delta"—the gap between "okay" and "mastery"—and closes it. This logic isn't just for Claude; you can grab this architecture and drop it right into codex-cli, terminal agents, or whatever stack you're building. I’m a big believer in the law of causality. Action, reaction.

I have always wanted to do an ablation study on this and recently I got the chance to do exactly that. Why? In applied domains like robotics, manufacturing, or banking, we rarely have the luxury of internet-scale diverse image datasets. We are often "Data Poor" in terms of diversity but "Data Rich" in depth. The takeaway? Density is efficient for facts but dangerous for reasoning (logical collapse) if you don't have larger scale data.
