I'm excited to introduce a new Space I've been developing called LLM Forest Orchestra. This project converts the hidden states and attention patterns of transformer models into layered MIDI compositions. The concept draws inspiration from mushrooms and mycelial networks in forests. Fungi create underground connections linking plants and trees, establishing what some call a "wood-wide web" where signals and nutrients travel. Researchers have discovered that these exchanges form patterns resembling rhythms and pulses. When translated appropriately, these patterns can become music. Transformers operate through remarkably similar principles: tokens share signals via hidden states and attention heads. This Space transforms those invisible information flows into notes, chords, and rhythms, treating the model as a digital forest orchestra. 🎛 Features * Two compute modes: - Full model operates on a Hugging Face model...</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:32:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Locutusque/640139873710354</guid></item><item><title>large AI labs have dropped so many open models last week 🔥 don't miss out on them</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/771481819901416</link><description>large AI labs have dropped so many open models last week 🔥 don't miss out on them → Apple released on-device vision LMs apple/fastvlm-68ac97b9cd5cacefdd04872e &amp; apple/mobileclip2-68ac947dcb035c54bcd20c47 → OpenGVLab released InternVL3.5, 32 new vision LMs with one based on gpt-oss!

It costs me nothing, and I think it might be good to share it so that others can build on it. In README.md, you will find everything you need to get started and put your own microservice into production, which you can call from the app’s HTTP request features. You will simply be asked to have a free Cloudflare account and an API key obtained from Google's AI Studio. Feel free to take a look and get back to me if you encounter any problems during deployment. Here is the GitHub repo where you can find all the source code and run it on your own:...</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:32:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/louisbrulenaudet/591445663705551</guid></item><item><title>PawMatchAI — Now with SBERT-Powered Recommendations! 🐶✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/381537695345047</link><description>PawMatchAI — Now with SBERT-Powered Recommendations! 🐶✨ ⭐️ NEW: Description-based recommendations are here! Just type in your lifestyle or preferences (e.g. “I live in an apartment and want a quiet dog”), and PawMatchAI uses SBERT semantic embeddings to understand your needs and suggest compatible breeds. What can PawMatchAI do today? 📸 Upload a photo to identify your dog from 124 breeds with detailed info. ⚖️ Compare two breeds side-by-side, from grooming needs to health insights. 📊 Visualize breed traits with radar and comparison charts. 🎨 Try Style Transfer to turn your dog’s photo into anime, watercolor, cyberpunk, and more.

Thought the approach might interest folks here. The issue I have had when trying to use some of the local LLMs with coding agents is this: Me: "Find all API endpoints with authentication in this codebase" LLM: "You should look for @ app .route decorators and check if they have auth middleware..." But I often want it to search the files and show me but the LLM doesn't trigger a tool use call. To fine-tune it for tool use I combined two data sources: 1. Magpie scenarios - 5000+ diverse tasks (bug hunting, refactoring, security audits) 2. Real execution - Ran these on actual repos (FastAPI, Django, React) to get authentic tool responses This ensures the model learns both breadth (many scenarios) and depth (real tool behavior). Tools We Taught: - read_file - Actually read file contents - search_files - Regex/pattern search across codebases - find_definition - Locate classes/functions - analyze_imports - Dependency tracking -...</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:32:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/510406818109359</guid></item><item><title>Introducing ShortiFoley 🎵 — an AI tool that transforms short videos into realistic Foley audio.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Bils/120204910303830</link><description>Introducing ShortiFoley 🎵 — an AI tool that transforms short videos into realistic Foley audio.

WebGPU-accelerated semantic video tracking, powered by DINOv3 and Transformers.js! 🤯 Demo (+ source code): webml-community/DINOv3-video-tracking This will revolutionize AI-powered video editors... which can now run 100% locally in your browser, no server inference required (costs $0)! 😍 How does it work? 🤔 1️⃣ Generate and cache image features for each frame 2️⃣ Create a list of embeddings for selected patch(es) 3️⃣ Compute cosine similarity between each patch and the selected patch(es) 4️⃣ Highlight those whose score is above some threshold ... et voilà! 🥳 You can also make selections across frames to improve temporal consistency! This is super useful if the object changes its appearance slightly throughout the video. Excited to see what the community builds with it!

Simply put; training something with features gives a fair representative of the learning that you would get from running a model that has some random chance - using a single seed. Training with features does not need to wait for the representative model to actually generate; since you already generated everything ahead of time. Features are rich and utilizable within the spectrum of similarity assessments, classification accuracy, mass-deterministic normalization checks, and more. They are... put simply... exponentially faster and reusable for research. I'll include the notebooks used for imagenet and cifar100; as the cifar100 is much simpler since the cifar100 is much... smaller, I required less innovation. Imagenet is another beast though. This imagenet notebook is capable of running against much larger datasets with a few tweaks. clip-vit-bigG's imagenet feature set is complete, which means we're almost ready for full ablation.
