For any AI agent, internet search 🔎 is an important tool. However, with APIs like Tavily and Exa, it becomes really difficult to keep up with the cost. In some cases, these Internet APIs cost more than the LLM. To solve, this, I am making a playwright wrapper API on top of publicly available searXNG instances. This will enable agent applications to fetch internet results for free. Currently, I have set up a basic GitHub repo, and I will continue developing advanced search features, such as image search 🖼️ Github: https://github.com/HanzlaJavaid/Free-Search/tree/main 🚀 Try the deployed version: https://freesearch.replit.app/docs If you find this useful, consider starring ⭐️ the GitHub repository to support further development!

You can now train and finetune reranker models with multi-GPU training, bf16 support, loss logging, callbacks &amp; much more. I also prove that finetuning on your domain helps much more than you might think. 1️⃣ Reranker Training Refactor Reranker models can now be trained using an extensive trainer with a lot of powerful features: - MultiGPU Training (Data Parallelism (DP) and Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP)) - bf16 training support; loss logging - Evaluation datasets + evaluation loss - Improved callback support + an excellent Weights &amp; Biases integration - Gradient checkpointing, gradient accumulation - Model card generation - Resuming from a training checkpoint without performance loss - Hyperparameter Optimization and much more!
