Today I focused on setting up gpu poor hardware to run GRPO. This is a plain TRL and PEFT notebook which works on mac silicone or colab T4. This uses the 1b variant of Gemma 3 and a reasoning version of GSM8K dataset. 🧑‍🍳 There’s more still in the oven like releasing models, an Unsloth version, and deeper tutorials, but hopefully this should bootstrap your projects. Here’s a link to the 1b notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mwCy5GQb9xJFSuwt2L_We3eKkVbx2qSt?usp=sharing See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:23:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/988620578150041</guid></item><item><title>🌐 GraphMind: Phi-3 Instruct Graph Explorer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/554089753491641</link><description>🌐 GraphMind: Phi-3 Instruct Graph Explorer ✨ Extract and visualize knowledge graphs from any text in multiple languages!

This is my summaries of their differentiations. I don't think these two players are coordinated but they both have clear goals. One is to build ecosystem and the other is to push AGI. And IMO they are both doing really well.
