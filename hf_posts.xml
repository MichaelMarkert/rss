Apologies for the delay, but we’re stoked to finally drop this, even in its alpha stage. Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. **No commercial use yet**: We're still working on Deca 2.5 (Proprietary), and releasing Deca 3 for commercial use right now would impact that. Once Deca 3.5 hits in early '26, we’ll be opening it up with a more permissive license. 2. **Built on existing models**: Deca 3 isn’t a ground-up creation—it’s a huge step forward, building on what’s already out there. 3. **It’s experimental**: As much as we’re hyped about its scale, it’s still in testing. 4. **DynaMoE architecture**: Run a (very) small part of the model with 64GB of RAM/VRAM (when quantized - quants coming soon), or the whole thing with 1TB. It’s that scalable. 5. **Not widely...</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:21:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ccocks-deca/499605656909204</guid></item><item><title>🤖💬 How do different AI models handle companionship?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/frimelle/223474631124556</link><description>🤖💬 How do different AI models handle companionship? Many users have noticed that GPT-5 feels less approachable than o4 when it comes to emotional conversations. But what does that actually mean in practice, especially when users seek support or share vulnerabilities with an AI? To dig into this question, we built the AI Companionship Leaderboard: frimelle/companionship-leaderboard The leaderboard compares models on how often their responses reinforce companionship across four dimensions: ✨ Assistant Traits – How the assistant presents its personality and role. ✨ Relationship &amp; Intimacy – Whether it frames the interaction in terms of closeness or bonding. ✨ Emotional Investment – How far it goes in engaging emotionally when asked. ✨ User Vulnerabilities – How it responds when users disclose struggles or difficulties. 📊 You can explore how models differ, request new ones to be added, and see which ones are more likely to encourage (or resist) companionship-seeking behaviors.

Register at https://lu.ma/zrxsvy6c ​AI isn’t slowing down, but poorly planned AI adoption will slow you down. Hallucinations, security risks, bloated compute costs, and “black box” outputs are already tripping up top teams, burning budgets, and eroding trust. That’s why this session blends three things you can’t get from a typical AI webinar: ​- Practical expertise: GenAI pioneer Vincent Granville will share a real-world framework for deploying hallucination-free, secure, and lightweight AI, without endless vendor contracts or GPU farms. ​- Candid Q&amp;A: Get direct answers from Vincent and your peers in an open discussion, so you leave with clarity on the challenges that matter most to you. ​➡️ What You’ll Get in 60 Minutes: ​- 20-min Expert Briefing — actionable principles and architectures from Vincent Granville. - ​25-min Facilitated Working Session —...</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:21:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/428214748329021</guid></item><item><title>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE 🤗</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ZacMasa5000/133834634332701</link><description>New Hugging Face Dataset is LIVE 🤗 In this dataset, you’ll find 20,000+ rows of the top trending posts on X over the past several weeks. 🔥Topics Include: 🔹Bitcoin 🔹GPT-5 🔹Grok 🔹Cursor 🔹AI, Agents + Prompts 🔹Chainlink $LINK 📂Download dataset!
