But can they follow the story?🤔 Today, we introduce TimeScope: The benchmark that separates true temporal understanding from marketing hype. Let's see how much VLMs really understand!⏳ We test three skills that matter for real-world use: 🔎 Localized Retrieval: Find a specific action. 🧩 Information Synthesis: Piece together scattered clues. 🏃 Fine-Grained Perception: Analyze detailed motion (e.g., count how many times a person swings an axe). The results are in, and they're revealing. Only Gemini 2.5 pro handles 1-hour-long videos. Performance drops sharply with duration, proving that long video understanding is still challenging. We've found the breaking points—now the community can start fixing them.📈 Want to learn more? TimeScope is 100% open-source.

So... why this change? Typing huggingface-cli constantly gets old fast. More importantly, the CLI’s command structure became messy as new features were added over time (upload, download, cache management, repo management, etc.). Renaming the CLI is a chance to reorganize commands into a clearer, more consistent format. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead follow a well-known CLI pattern: hf &lt;resource&gt; &lt;action&gt;. Isn't hf auth login easier to type and remember? The full rationale, implementation details, and migration notes are in the blog post: https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-cli See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:24:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Wauplin/921235032674409</guid></item><item><title>Excited to introduce the new experimental model "Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Abliterated-Caption-it", which is performing exceptionally well on image captioning tasks.

We align the multimodal model using multiple optimization objectives (losses), guided by a preference dataset (chosen vs. rejected multimodal pairs).
