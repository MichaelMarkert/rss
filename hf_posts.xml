In this paper, the authors investigate this aspect: - using open models, where prompting can be fully customized by the user, including special tokens. - focusing on open-source models like Olmo, where full training data is available. 📤 How do they extract data? During post-training (like SFT), new tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt; are introduced. The authors hypothesize prompting the model with these tokens can make it output its alignment data (remember Magpie?). For example, for SFT, their extraction prompt is &lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|user|&gt;. 📏 Evaluating memorization The authors compare each sampled example with the original data using vector search with embedding similarity. They find that many outputs are semantically very similar to the original...</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 05:22:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/anakin87/201202681111752</guid></item><item><title>Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! 🎉</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729</link><description>Reached 1000+ total downloads across my models and datasets! 🎉 Follow me for more @ ronantakizawa See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 05:22:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ronantakizawa/435117440357729</guid></item><item><title>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/evalstate/865812476358807</link><description>Hugging Face MCP Server v0.2.45 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New!

The time can vary, usually a duration is set from several minutes to a few hours. Unlike sketches, speed paintings may be considered "finished" after the time limit is up. https://miragic.ai/products/speed-painting See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 05:22:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/wang12390/240552732492093</guid></item><item><title>NEW RESEARCH MODEL:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/132208004167060</link><description>NEW RESEARCH MODEL: vanta-research/atom-v1-preview-4b We are excited to share our Atom V1 4B Preview model! This fine tuned Gemma3 4B variant has a distinct, friendly, and exploratory persona - designed to help the user think and reflect. Atom is trained to ask questions, use approachable, yet relatable analogies in ELI5-style explanations, and engage in deep, reflective conversation. We plan to scale Atom's persona to larger architectures, and this iteration was created as part of that R&amp;D. Any and all feedback is always welcome as we continue to refine our approach.
