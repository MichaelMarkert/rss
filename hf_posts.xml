Available today! üîµ In the blue corner, the versatile challenger with a proven track record of knowledge retrieval: LlamaIndex! üõë In the red corner, the defender, weighing in with lightweight efficiency: Hugging Face smolagents! üîó URL: https://huggingface.co/agents-course We just published the LlamaIndex unit for the agents course, and it is set to offer a great contrast between the smolagents unit by looking at - What makes llama-index stand-out - How the LlamaHub is used for integrations - Creating QueryEngine components - Using agents and tools - Agentic and multi-agent workflows The team has been working flat-out on this for a few weeks. Supported by Logan Markewich and Laurie Voss over at LlamaIndex. Who won? You decide!

If you want to create your own thinking model or do a better MistralThinker, I just uploaded my entire dataset made on Deepseek R1 and the axolotl config. (well I made them public) Axolotl config : Undi95/MistralThinker-v1.1 The dataset : Undi95/R1-RP-ShareGPT3 You can also read all I did on those two discord screenshot from two days ago, I'm a little lazy to rewrite all kek. Hope you will use them!

What makes this dataset unique, useful, and capable of bridging the Sim2Real gap? üí† The digital twins are not generated by AI, but instead crafted by 3D artists to be INDISTINGUISHABLE from the physical-world objects. This allows the training from this data to transfer into real-world applicability üí† The simulation software, called FalconEditor, can easily create thousands of images with varying lighting, posing, occlusions, backgrounds, camera positions, and more. This enables robust model training. üí† The labels are created along with the data. This not only saves large amounts of time, but also ensures the...</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/775086617889949</guid></item><item><title>Published a stable version of Ukrainian Text-to-Speech library on GitHub and PyPI.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Yehor/619825346186306</link><description>Published a stable version of Ukrainian Text-to-Speech library on GitHub and PyPI. Features: - Multi-speaker model: 2 female (Tetiana, Lada) + 1 male (Mykyta) voices; - Fine-grained control over speech parameters, including duration, fundamental frequency (F0), and energy; - High-fidelity speech generation using the RAD-TTS++ acoustic model; - Fast vocoding using Vocos; - Synthesizes long sentences effectively; - Supports a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz; - Tested on Linux environments and Windows/WSL; - Python API (requires Python 3.9 or later); - CUDA-enabled for GPU acceleration.

With the latest release of smolagents, you can now securely execute Python code in sandboxed Docker or E2B environments. ü¶æüîí Here's why this is a game-changer for agent-based systems: üßµüëá 1Ô∏è‚É£ Security First üîê Running AI agents in unrestricted Python environments is risky! With sandboxing, your agents are isolated, preventing unintended file access, network abuse, or system modifications. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deterministic &amp; Reproducible Runs üì¶ By running agents in containerized environments, you ensure that every execution happens in a controlled and predictable setting‚Äîno more environment mismatches or dependency issues! 3Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Control &amp; Limits üö¶ Docker and E2B allow you to enforce CPU, memory, and execution time limits, so rogue or inefficient agents don‚Äôt spiral out of control. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Safer Code Execution in Production üè≠ Deploy AI agents confidently, knowing that any generated code runs in an ephemeral, isolated environment, protecting your host machine and...</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/albertvillanova/674737128301579</guid></item><item><title>I‚Äôm super excited to work with</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/281561952705692</link><description>I‚Äôm super excited to work with @ mlabonne to build the first practical example in the reasoning course. üîó https://huggingface.co/reasoning-course Here's a quick walk through of the first drop of material that works toward the use case: - a fundamental introduction to reinforcement learning. Answering questions like, ‚Äòwhat is a reward?‚Äô and ‚Äòhow do we create an environment for a language model?‚Äô - Then it focuses on Deepseek R1 by walking through the paper and highlighting key aspects. This is an old school way to learn ML topics, but it always works. - Next, it takes to you Transformers Reinforcement Learning and demonstrates potential reward functions you could use. This is cool because it uses Marimo notebooks to visualise the reward. - Finally, Maxime walks us through a real training notebook that uses GRPO to reduce generation length. I‚Äôm really into this because it works and Maxime took the time to validate it share assets and logging from his own runs for you to compare with....</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/281561952705692</guid></item><item><title>Qilin üî•a large scale multimodal dataset for search, recommendation and RAG research, released by Xiaohongshu &amp; Tsinghua University</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/245501501333845</link><description>Qilin üî•a large scale multimodal dataset for search, recommendation and RAG research, released by Xiaohongshu &amp; Tsinghua University Dataset: THUIR/Qilin Paper: Qilin: A Multimodal Information Retrieval Dataset with APP-level User Sessions (2503.00501) ‚ú®Multiple content modalities (text, images, video thumbnails) ‚ú®Rich user interaction data ( from Xiaohongshu‚Äôs 300M+ MAUs, 70%+ search penetration) ‚ú®Comprehensive evaluation metrics ‚ú®Support for RAG system development See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/245501501333845</guid></item><item><title>New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928</link><description>New amazing updates arrived to our ultimate Wan 2.1 (1-Click Install) Gradio APP Source : https://www.patreon.com/posts/123105403 Tutorial video : https://youtu.be/hnAhveNy-8s Please checkout the screenshots See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/739966885386928</guid></item></channel></rss>
