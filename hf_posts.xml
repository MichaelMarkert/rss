We've trained the first DSE model based on this model, and it's already performing at the same level as Jina v4! While Jina Embeddings v4 is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B (which has a non-commercial license), our model is based on Qwen3-VL-4B and released under Apache 2.0‚Äîmaking it fully commercially permissive.

Inspired by Meta's CWM (Code World Model) research, this LoRA adapter adds execution awareness to Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507. The model learns to predict variable states, trace program execution step-by-step, and debug code by understanding runtime behavior. üîç Key Innovation: We combine Qwen3's native thinking capabilities with real Python execution traces captured via sys.settrace(). The model is trained using GRPO with a custom reward function that scores execution prediction accuracy. üìä Training Approach: - Hybrid Magpie-style code generation - Real execution tracing for ground truth - Self-supervised learning (no manual annotations!) - 298 training samples with execution traces ‚ú® What it does: - Predicts variable states at each line of code - Explains execution flow with thinking tags - Helps debug by understanding...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:27:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/654123549897898</guid></item><item><title>ü§ñ New article: In-depth testing of the Feetech STS3215 servomotor ‚Äî the popular choice for open-source robotic projects like SO-ARM 100 and others.

The post walks through the results, trade-offs, and what I learned about embedding API terms of service. The main motivation for using USearch is that CPU compute is cheap and easy to scale.

They can help you capture what‚Äôs happening in AI from multiple angles: 1. Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again) ‚Üí https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ Unveils Software 3.0 ‚Äì a paradigm where LLMs are the new computers, programmed with prompts instead of code. The key: developers must now master coding, training, and prompting as AI becomes the heart of software building 2. Richard Sutton, The OaK Architecture: A Vision of SuperIntelligence from Experience ‚Üí https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbbGyNkR2U Unveils the OaK (Options and Knowledge) architecture ‚Äì a model-based RL framework for continual intelligence, where every component learns, meta-learns &amp; builds hierarchical abstractions 3.

This is Glyph, Zai‚Äôs new visual-text compression voodoo: ‚Ä¢ 10 k words ‚Üí 3 PNGs ‚âà 3 k visual tokens ‚Ä¢ Compression ratio: 4.3√ó ‚Ä¢ Throughput: 40-60 tok/s i.e. your context window now finishes before my coffee does So I did the only reasonable thing: asked GLM-4.6 to port Glyph for Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking. Translation: I made one model compress a novel into a comic strip, then made another model read the comic strip and still ace QA. It‚Äôs basically passing notes in class, except the note is a 1920√ó1080 meme and the teacher is a transformer. We've gone from "Attention is All You Need" to "Attention is Too Expensive, Just Use Your Eyes." Remember kids: in 2025 literacy is optional, but JPEG is forever.

[1]</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/piercus/315056772255613</link><description>üöß Reproducing LBM-Eraser‚Ä¶ in progress! [1] When repurposing a T2I model into a pure I2I model, there‚Äôs always that orphaned text path ‚Äî what do we do with it? ü§î You can reuse it as learnable embeddings in multi-task setups [2], freeze an empty text prompt, distillate or prune the corresponding part. In LBM, they take a clever route ‚Äî zeroing [3] and reshaping [4] the text-related cross-attentions into self-attentions. This gives you fresh weights for I2I computation, nicely integrated into your SD architecture. üìé References [1] Our LBM Fork: https://github.com/finegrain-ai/LBM [2] OmniPaint: OmniPaint: Mastering Object-Oriented Editing via Disentangled Insertion-Removal Inpainting (2503.08677) [3] LBM Zeroing: https://github.com/gojasper/LBM/blob/cafebc46a9ac16dcc61691d289cc4676b5c75380/examples/training/train_lbm_surface.py#L147-L148 [4] LBM Reshaping: https://github.com/gojasper/LBM/blob/cafebc46a9ac16dcc61691d289cc4676b5c75380/examples/training/train_lbm_surface.py#L100 See...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:27:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/piercus/315056772255613</guid></item></channel></rss>
