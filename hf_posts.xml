My favorite new feature? 🤔 The new dynamic weight loader + converter. Here’s why 👇 Over the last few months, the core Transformers maintainers built an incredibly fast weight loader, capable of converting tensors on the fly while loading them in parallel threads. This means we’re no longer constrained by how parameters are laid out inside the safetensors weight files. In practice, this unlocks two big things: - Much more modular modeling code. You can now clearly see how architectures build on top of each other (DeepSeek v2 → v3, Qwen v2 → v3 → MoE, etc.). This makes shared bottlenecks obvious and lets us optimize the right building blocks once, for all model families. - Performance optimizations beyond what torch.compile can do alone. torch.compile operates on the computation graph, but it can’t change...</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/848772925772411</guid></item><item><title>ovi054/LTX-2-19b-Squish-LoRA</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ovi054/176731931119322</link><description>ovi054/LTX-2-19b-Squish-LoRA ⚡ I trained a Squish LoRA for LTX-2.

So I built **SecureCode**: a collection of **8 code models (3B → 20B)** trained to behave more like a security reviewer. What you should expect from SecureCode: - identify likely vuln patterns and explain *why* they’re risky - outline plausible abuse paths (defensive framing) - propose a secure rewrite (drop-in where possible) - include defense-in-depth guidance + regression tests/checks Links: - **Models:** https://huggingface.co/collections/scthornton/securecode - **Dataset:** scthornton/securecode-v2 - **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/html/2512.18542v1 SecureCode v2.0: A Production-Grade Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models (2512.18542) **How to test it (copy/paste prompt):** &gt; You are a...</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/scthornton/483996346337767</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Article: *Post-Transformer Decision Cores* (v0.1)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/711602614783831</link><description>✅ New Article: *Post-Transformer Decision Cores* (v0.1) Title: 🚀 Post-Transformer Decision Cores: Goal-Native Engines Beyond LLMs 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/post-tranformer-decision-cores --- Summary: Transformers are powerful—but in SI-Core they’re *not the essence of intelligence*. A *Decision Core* is anything that satisfies the *Jump contracts* (OBS/ETH/MEM/ID/EVAL + RML), and those contracts don’t require next-token prediction. This article sketches what “post-Transformer” looks like in practice: *goal-native, structure-aware controllers* that may use LLMs as tools—but don’t depend on them as the runtime brain. &gt; Don’t relax the contracts. &gt; Replace the engine behind them. --- Why It Matters: • Makes LLMs *optional*: shift them to “genesis / exploration / explanation,” while routine high-stakes Jumps run on structured cores • Improves boring-but-critical properties: *determinism (CAS), fewer inconsistencies (SCI), fewer ETH violations (EAI), better rollback...</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/711602614783831</guid></item><item><title>Introducing OpenMALx</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/tegridydev/651013007690920</link><description>Introducing OpenMALx openmalx Repository for Infosec and Machine Learning Resources OpenMALx is an organization focused on the development of datasets and models for security analysis.

Building models isn’t just for big labs anymore — with the right data, compute, and workflow, you can create **custom AI models** and **tokenizers** tailored to any domain. Whether it’s NLP, domain‑specific datasets, or experimental architectures, training from scratch gives you full control over vocabulary, embeddings, and performance. ✨ Why train your own? - Full control over vocabulary &amp; tokenization - Domain‑specific optimization (medical, legal, technical, etc.) - Better performance on niche datasets - Freedom to experiment with architectures ⚡ The best part? - Tokenizer training (TikToken / BPE) can be done in **just 3 lines of code**. - Model training runs smoothly on **Google Colab notebooks** — no expensive hardware required. 📂 Try out my work: - 🔗 https://github.com/OE-Void/Tokenizer-from_scratch - 🔗 https://github.com/OE-Void/GPT See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/254137909606959</guid></item><item><title>HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/wangbuer999/572194851679348</link><description>HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct just dropped fresh -sourceImage 3.0model!
