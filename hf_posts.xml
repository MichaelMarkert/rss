Today we offer you these 6 must-read surveys that can be your perfect guides to the major fields and techniques: 1. Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu ‚Üí https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09223 Many recommend this 270-page book as a good resource to focus on fundamental concepts, such as pre-training, generative models, prompting, alignment, and inference 2. Large Language Models Post-Training: Surveying Techniques from Alignment to Reasoning -&gt; A Survey on Post-training of Large Language Models (2503.06072) Read this to master policy optimization (RLHF, DPO, GRPO), supervised and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, reasoning, integration, and adaptation techniques 3. Agentic Large Language Models, a survey by Leiden University ‚Üí https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23037 Surveys agentic LLMs across reasoning, tools, and...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 05:32:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/570379597864718</guid></item><item><title>Kimi K2 tech report is full of gems as always.

Here are my notes on it: &gt; MuonClip: Pretty crazy how after 70k the training stabilizes and the QK-clip is basically inactive. There is also no loss in perf with QK-clip which is not trivial at all (at small scale but with aggressive threshold). Also a cool explanation of why muon makes the logit explode in appendix E (tl;dr is that muon makes the singular value of the update matrix higher) &gt; Sparsity scaling laws to justify their ratio, they have a very solid training infra that allows the model to be trained at this sparsity level, they could have increased even more but as sparsity increases the training becomes less efficient. &gt; They diminish the number of attention heads to make it more efficient for long context since attention heads are a big bottleneck for long context. They also remove 2 of the 3 "first dense" layers in the dsv3 arch. With the sparsity and attention heads (divided by 2) they achieve 83% increased flops compared...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 05:32:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/eliebak/684400126414992</guid></item><item><title>üß¨ Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face üî¨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MaziyarPanahi/751516664507693</link><description>üß¨ Breaking news in Clinical AI: Introducing the OpenMed NER Model Discovery App on Hugging Face üî¨ OpenMed is back! üî• Finding the right biomedical NER model just became as precise as a PCR assay!

And my personal favorite so far - I adore peak performance at small/nano scale. Everyone deserves to run/train AGI locally:) our data, our god model! They showed that: - you can train LLMs (upto 1B params) with as low as batch_size=1. This is unconventional given small batch sizes can lead to unstable/spiky training runs. - you can have a stable train run with just vanilla SGD(stochastic gradient descent), no momentum requiredü§Ø - small batch sizes are more robust to hyperparameters (i.e no worries with initialization) - smaller batch sizes outperforms (‚Äúbetter per-Flops performance‚Äù) larger batch sizes. ‚ÄúWe recommend that practitioners training large models in memory-constrained settings exploit the benefits of small batch sizes rather than trying to emulate the large batch size setting (e.g., through gradient accumulation) typically used in industry.‚Äù I‚Äôve been doing this for ages - my mantra: all my experiments must scale on...</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 05:32:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/640818601212021</guid></item><item><title>Now it's possible to do RAG with any-to-any models üî•</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/633613682232574</link><description>Now it's possible to do RAG with any-to-any models üî• Learn how to search in a video dataset and generate using Tevatron/OmniEmbed-v0.1-multivent an all modality retriever, and Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B , any-to-any model in this notebook ü§ù merve/smol-vision See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 05:32:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/633613682232574</guid></item><item><title>Upgraded the step-by-step notebook for fine-tuning SigLIP2 on domain-specific image classification tasks.
