As we close this chapter, we're laying the groundwork for a more modular and community-driven future: - Optimum v2: A lightweight core package for porting Transformers, Diffusers, or Sentence-Transformers to specialized AI hardware/software/accelerators.. - Optimum‑ONNX: A dedicated package where the ONNX/ONNX Runtime ecosystem lives and evolves, faster-moving and decoupled from the Optimum core. 🎯 Why this matters: - A clearer governance path for ONNX, fostering stronger community collaboration and improved developer experience.. - Enable innovation at a faster pace in a more modular, open-source environment. 💡 What this means: - More transparency, broader participation, and faster development driven by the community and key actors in the ONNX ecosystem (PyTorch, Microsoft, Joshua Lochner 👀, ...) - A cleaner, more maintainable core Optimum, focused on extending HF libraries to special AI...</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IlyasMoutawwakil/721004690541036</guid></item><item><title>past week in open AI was insane 🔥 here's some of picks, find more here</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/514822650680483</link><description>past week in open AI was insane 🔥 here's some of picks, find more here merve/releases-july-25-688768ca47fe3693407e02d1 💬 LLMs &amp; VLMs &gt; Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 had a new update (OS) &gt; Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct is out with 480B total 35B active params 🤯 (OS) &gt; AllenAI dropped an update to allenai/olmOCR-7B-0725 📝 &gt; InternLM released internlm/Intern-S1 - 235B Qwen3 MoE + 6B InternViT encoder (OS) &gt; OmniSVG/OmniSVG is a new SVG generation VLM (OS) 🖼️ image/video/3D generation &gt; WanAI released Wan2.2 series - both T2V and I2V 14B models for high-quality video generation (OS) multimodalart/wan-22-688767e313337b434ed55112 &gt; Tencent dropped tencent/HunyuanWorld-1 - image-to-3D scene generation model See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/514822650680483</guid></item><item><title>Skywork UniPic 🔥a unified autoregressive multimodal model for image understanding, generation, &amp; editing, by Skywork 天工</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/618670304840857</link><description>Skywork UniPic 🔥a unified autoregressive multimodal model for image understanding, generation, &amp; editing, by Skywork 天工 Skywork/skywork-unipic-6888c0789cdb82457b2acf32 ✨ 1.5 B - MIT License ✨ Runs on RTX 4090 ✨ Truly unified architecture See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/618670304840857</guid></item><item><title>Qwen just released Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 🔥 an upgrade to the non-thinking mode model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/246049488455702</link><description>Qwen just released Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 🔥 an upgrade to the non-thinking mode model Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 ✨ 30B MoE / 3.3B active - Apache 2.0 ✨ Strong gains in reasoning, math, coding, &amp; multilingual tasks ✨ Native support for 256K long-context inputs See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/246049488455702</guid></item><item><title>When you're looking for data, what's your focus (use the reactions below to vote):</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/147929225613950</link><description>When you're looking for data, what's your focus (use the reactions below to vote): 🚀 Getting as many images as you can 🤯 Getting the right type of images (framing, domain, lighting, etc) I know both are very important, but I'm curious what people would put as #1 See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DualityAI-RebekahBogdanoff/147929225613950</guid></item><item><title>Latest work on SWE-Bench 🐛</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/YerbaPage/437092763804097</link><description>Latest work on SWE-Bench 🐛 Our two new papers from the SJTU &amp; Huawei: Powered by DeepSeek-V3, we've achieved a new SOTA on the SWE-Bench benchmark!
