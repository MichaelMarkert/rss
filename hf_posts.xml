To stay up to date with what‚Äôs happening in RL, we offer some fresh materials on it: 1. "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert -&gt; https://rlhfbook.com/ It's a short introduction to RLHF, explaining instruction tuning, reward modeling, alignment methods, synthetic data, evaluation, and more 2. "A Course in Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition)" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas -&gt; https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html Explains dynamic programming (DP) and RL, diving into rollout algorithms, neural networks, policy learning, etc. It‚Äôs packed with solved exercises and real-world examples 3.

Our v2.0 quants set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU and KL Divergence, meaning you can now run &amp; fine-tune quantized LLMs while preserving as much accuracy as possible. Llama 4: unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct-GGUF DeepSeek-R1: unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-UD Gemma 3: unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF We made selective layer quantization much smarter. Instead of modifying only a subset of layers, we now dynamically quantize all layers so every layer has a different bit. Now, our dynamic method can be applied to all LLM architectures, not just MoE's. Blog with Details: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/dynamic-v2.0 All our future GGUF uploads will leverage Dynamic 2.0 and our hand curated 300K‚Äì1.5M token calibration dataset to improve conversational chat performance. For accurate benchmarking, we built an evaluation framework to match the reported 5-shot MMLU scores of Llama 4 and Gemma 3. This allowed apples-to-apples comparisons between full-...</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:52:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/766411311755038</guid></item><item><title>I'm excited to introduce VisionScout ‚Äîan interactive vision tool that makes computer vision both accessible and powerful! üëÄüîç</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/336452242310313</link><description>I'm excited to introduce VisionScout ‚Äîan interactive vision tool that makes computer vision both accessible and powerful! üëÄüîç What can VisionScout do right now? üñºÔ∏è Upload any image and detect 80 different object types using YOLOv8. üîÑ Instantly switch between Nano, Medium, and XLarge models depending on your speed vs. accuracy needs. üéØ Filter specific classes (people, vehicles, animals, etc.) to focus only on what matters to you. üìä View detailed statistics about detected objects, confidence levels, and spatial distribution. üé® Enjoy a clean, intuitive interface with responsive design and enhanced visualizations.

Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback-32k A few months ago, we published one of our most liked dataset with 13K images based on the @ data-is-better-together 's dataset, following Google's research on "Rich Human Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10240 ). It collected over 1.5M responses from 150K+ participants. Rapidata/text-2-image-Rich-Human-Feedback In the examples below, users highlighted words from prompts that were not correctly depicted in the generated images. Higher word scores indicate more frequent issues. If an image captured the prompt accurately, users could select [No_mistakes]. We're continuing to work on large-scale human feedback and model evaluation.

I've been diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol) to understand what the hype was all about. It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that can be hooked to LLMs. But while doing that, came my second realization: Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. ü§Ø ‚û°Ô∏è read it exclusively on the official HF blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/tiny-agents See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:52:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/julien-c/991263782380176</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ New paper out: "Improving Arabic Multi-Label Emotion Classification using Stacked Embeddings and Hybrid Loss Function"</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ImranzamanML/972513852482559</link><description>üöÄ New paper out: "Improving Arabic Multi-Label Emotion Classification using Stacked Embeddings and Hybrid Loss Function" Improving Arabic Multi-Label Emotion Classification using Stacked Embeddings and Hybrid Loss Function (2410.03979) In this work, we tackle some major challenges in Arabic multi-label emotion classification especially the issues of class imbalance and label correlation that often hurt model performance, particularly for minority emotions. Our approach: Stacked contextual embeddings from fine-tuned ArabicBERT, MarBERT, and AraBERT models. A meta-learning strategy that builds richer representations. A hybrid loss function combining class weighting, label correlation matrices, and contrastive learning to better handle class imbalances. üß† Model pipeline: stacked embeddings ‚Üí meta-learner ‚Üí Bi-LSTM ‚Üí fully connected network ‚Üí multi-label classification. üîç Extensive experiments show significant improvements across Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Jaccard Accuracy, and...</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:52:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ImranzamanML/972513852482559</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ Delighted to share a major milestone in adapting reasoning techniques for data collections augmentation!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/458849172237757</link><description>üöÄ Delighted to share a major milestone in adapting reasoning techniques for data collections augmentation!
