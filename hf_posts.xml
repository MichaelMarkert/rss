Not as easy as i expected, but I'm happy i was still able to have it working within a few hours after the original model was released! Interested in feedback if anyone wants to try it out! marksverdhei/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8 Note: If my PR to vLLM isn't merged yet you might have to use my fork.

The paper focuses on rigid body dynamics - collisions, pendulums, free fall, rolling.

Just finished training my multimodal model on the full LLaVA-Instruct-150K dataset (157K samples) and wanted to share the results! 🔧 What I Built: A vision-language model that can understand images and answer questions about them, combining: - Google Gemma-3-270M (language) - OpenAI CLIP ViT-Large/14 (vision) - LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency 📊 Training Stats: - 157,712 training samples (full LLaVA dataset) - 3 epochs on A100 40GB - ~9 hours training time - Final loss: 1.333 training / 1.430 validation - Only 18.6M trainable params (3.4% of 539M total) 📈 sagar007/multigemma Benchmark Results: - VQA Accuracy: 53.8% - Works great for: animal detection, room identification, scene understanding 🔗 **Try it yourself:** - 🤗 Model: sagar007/multigemma - 🎮 Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagar007/Multimodal-Gemma - 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/sagar431/multimodal-gemma-270m Built with PyTorch Lightning + MLflow...</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:37:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sagar007/387080486731099</guid></item><item><title>🏛️ Google Code Archive Dataset -</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nyuuzyou/331224318760046</link><description>🏛️ Google Code Archive Dataset - nyuuzyou/google-code-archive Expanding beyond the modern code series, this release presents a massive historical snapshot from the Google Code Archive. This dataset captures the open-source landscape from 2006 to 2016, offering a unique time capsule of software development patterns during the era before GitHub's dominance. Key Stats: - 65,825,565 files from 488,618 repositories - 47 GB compressed Parquet storage - 454 programming languages (Heavily featuring Java, PHP, and C++) - Extensive quality filtering (excluding vendor code and build artifacts) - Rich historical metadata: original repo names, file paths, and era-specific licenses This is one of those releases that I'm most interested in getting feedback on. Would you like to see more old code datasets?
