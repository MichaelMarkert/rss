We've trained the first DSE model based on this model, and it's already performing at the same level as Jina v4! While Jina Embeddings v4 is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B (which has a non-commercial license), our model is based on Qwen3-VL-4B and released under Apache 2.0—making it fully commercially permissive.

Inspired by Meta's CWM (Code World Model) research, this LoRA adapter adds execution awareness to Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507. The model learns to predict variable states, trace program execution step-by-step, and debug code by understanding runtime behavior. 🔍 Key Innovation: We combine Qwen3's native thinking capabilities with real Python execution traces captured via sys.settrace(). The model is trained using GRPO with a custom reward function that scores execution prediction accuracy. 📊 Training Approach: - Hybrid Magpie-style code generation - Real execution tracing for ground truth - Self-supervised learning (no manual annotations!) - 298 training samples with execution traces ✨ What it does: - Predicts variable states at each line of code - Explains execution flow with thinking tags - Helps debug by understanding...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 17:20:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/654123549897898</guid></item><item><title>today is going to be a great day for small models, are you ready?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/appvoid/680866662633308</link><description>today is going to be a great day for small models, are you ready?

Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded &gt;270...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 17:20:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495</guid></item><item><title>With</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/branikita/764373120316800</link><description>With Robonine team we released an open-source 3D-printed parallel gripper designed for robotics applications, compatible with popular budget servos like Feetech STS3215 and Waveshare ST3215. This precision gripper offers parallel jaw movement, real-time monitoring, and positioning accuracy of ±0.1°, making it ideal for both robotics enthusiasts and professionals. Complete build cost: Just $69.45–$74.45, with all components available for purchase on Amazon. Direct links are provided in the Bill of Materials on GitHub. Check out the project on github: https://github.com/roboninecom/3D-Printed-Parallel-Gripper-for-Robotics-Arms We encourage you to Watch, Fork, and Star the repository to support our open-source initiative and stay updated on future developments. Your feedback is also welcome!

This is Glyph, Zai’s new visual-text compression voodoo: • 10 k words → 3 PNGs ≈ 3 k visual tokens • Compression ratio: 4.3× • Throughput: 40-60 tok/s i.e. your context window now finishes before my coffee does So I did the only reasonable thing: asked GLM-4.6 to port Glyph for Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking. Translation: I made one model compress a novel into a comic strip, then made another model read the comic strip and still ace QA. It’s basically passing notes in class, except the note is a 1920×1080 meme and the teacher is a transformer. We've gone from "Attention is All You Need" to "Attention is Too Expensive, Just Use Your Eyes." Remember kids: in 2025 literacy is optional, but JPEG is forever.

The post walks through the results, trade-offs, and what I learned about embedding API terms of service. The main motivation for using USearch is that CPU compute is cheap and easy to scale.
