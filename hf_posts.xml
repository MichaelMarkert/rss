Not much sleep, but lots of progress! So I managed to build the first MVP version of my custom Gradio component, azettl/gradio_consilium_roundtable ( https://pypi.org/project/gradio-consilium-roundtable/ ). This creates a visual roundtable component for AI consensus discussions. Displays AI participants as avatars positioned around an oval table (poker style!) with animated speech bubbles, thinking states, and real-time discussion updates. Also, I managed to get a rough draft of the Gradio app + MCP server done, but not so much yet that I can share the space with you. You will be able to define your question the AI participants should discuss, decide on the protocol, do role assignments like having a devil's advocate on the table, and define the communication pattern. Lastly, you can decide which AI should be the moderator and how...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:21:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/azettl/397733899741459</guid></item><item><title>üß† We just implemented Andrej Karpathy's "third paradigm" for LLM learning!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200</link><description>üß† We just implemented Andrej Karpathy's "third paradigm" for LLM learning! System Prompt Learning (SPL) enables LLMs to automatically learn problem-solving strategies from experience, rather than relying on static prompts. üöÄ How it works: Your LLM builds a database of effective strategies, selects the best ones for each problem, and refines them over time based on success rates. üìä Results across math benchmarks: Arena Hard: 29% ‚Üí 37.6% (+8.6%) AIME24: 23.33% ‚Üí 30% (+6.67%) OptILLMBench: 61% ‚Üí 65% (+4%) The best part? All strategies are human-readable and the system gets progressively better at problem types you use frequently. ‚ú® Key benefits: üîÑ Cumulative learning over time üìñ Transparent, inspectable strategies üîå Works with any OpenAI-compatible API ‚ö° Simple integration: just add "spl-" prefix to your model Built as an open-source plugin in optillm. After 500 queries, our system developed 129 strategies and refined 97 of them! This feels like a genuine step toward AI that learns...</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:21:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codelion/495839598023200</guid></item><item><title>HALOOO MY COMMUNITY</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/attackerElvies/415846064784363</link><description>HALOOO MY COMMUNITY</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:21:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/attackerElvies/415846064784363</guid></item><item><title>The AI Memory Layer Will Change Everything ‚ÄºÔ∏è</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/shivance/186510046131128</link><description>The AI Memory Layer Will Change Everything ‚ÄºÔ∏è Why do even the smartest AIs like OpenAI's o3 and GPT-4o, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude forget?
