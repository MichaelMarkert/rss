As agents become more autonomous, the real challenge shifts from generation to governance: understanding when, why, and under what constraints an agent should act. At GoDaddy, we’ve been treating context as a first-class primitive for agentic systems — combining identity, intent, permissions, and environment so agents can operate responsibly in production. Context is what turns automation into judgment. Without it, autonomy becomes risk. This post outlines how we’re thinking about the transition from task execution to context-aware agentic systems, and what that means for building AI that can be trusted at scale. 👉 How we build context for agentic AI: https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/how-godaddy-builds-context-for-agentic-ai Curious how others here are modeling context, trust boundaries, and decision constraints in agentic architectures.

This article is about *where that meaning lives*—and how to keep it *queryable, explainable, and governable* using two layers: * *SIM*: operational semantic memory (low-latency, recent, jump-loop-adjacent) * *SIS*: archival/analytic semantic store (long retention, heavy queries, audits) Core idea: store “meaning” as *typed semantic units* with scope, provenance, goal tags, retention, and *backing_refs* (URI/hash/ledger anchors) so you can answer *“why did we do X?”* without turning memory into a blob. --- Why It Matters: • Prevents “semantic junk drawer” memory: *units become contracts*, not vibes • Makes audits and incidents tractable: *reconstruct semantic context* (L3-grade) • Preserves reversibility/accountability with...</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:31:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/596222805860445</guid></item><item><title>CRAFT Framework Beta: 20 days awayApplying OOP to AI workflows—recipes, cookbooks, and persistent context across sessions.70+ weeks of solo development.
