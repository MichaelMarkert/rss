Maybe we have better LLM model in brain than that of cat and dog? 猫和狗都拥有像人类一样的强化学习能力、视觉和听觉。而且它们跑跳等方面的表现甚至比擎天柱还要出色。为什么人类可以饲养猫和狗呢？或许我们的大脑拥有比猫狗更优秀的大语言模型？ See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/John1604/431236892313740</guid></item><item><title>No SOTA from gpt5 codex</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/122975793150084</link><description>No SOTA from gpt5 codex onekq-ai/WebApp1K-models-leaderboard See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/onekq/122975793150084</guid></item><item><title>Need Help Getting arXiv Endorsement for My AI Research Paper</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/574430859110807</link><description>Need Help Getting arXiv Endorsement for My AI Research Paper Hi everyone, I hope you're doing well. I’m trying to publish my new AI research paper on arXiv under the cs.AI category, but I currently need an endorser who is already authorized for cs.AI submissions. If anyone here is registered as a cs.AI endorser and is willing to help, I would truly appreciate it. Here is the official arXiv endorsement request link: 🔗 https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=EZEMO7 (Backup: http://arxiv.org/auth/endorse.php — Code: EZEMO7) My research: It’s part of the AetherMind project — a self-reflective NLI reasoning system inspired by human cognitive consistency and used also in Alzheimer’s research. If needed, I can share the abstract or full PDF. Thank you so much to anyone who can support. — Sameer S.Najm See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/samerzaher80/574430859110807</guid></item><item><title>Hey everyone! 👋</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/751562087510582</link><description>Hey everyone! 👋 I am thrilled to present MCP-1st-Birthday/Reuben_OS my submission for the Hugging Face MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon (Creative Track). ReubenOS is a virtual cloud-based operating system designed specifically to act as a backend for Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It gives Claude a persistent environment to work in! ✨ Key Features * 📱 Flutter IDE: Claude can write Flutter code and I can view/execute the files directly in the ReubenOS dashboard. * 🎵 AI Audio Studio: Integrated with ElevenLabs to generate songs and voiceovers from text prompts within Claude. * 🔒 Secure File System: A passkey-protected file system (private &amp; public folders) to store code, JSON, and documents. * 🧠 Gemini Integration: Access Google's Gemini model directly inside the OS. * 📝 Quiz Engine: Ask Claude to "Create a Python quiz," and it deploys a graded interactive quiz to the web instantly.

It lets an AI models navigate a room, interpret a scene, or figure out how objects fit together, like giving it a built-in mental map. For example, world models can't live without spatial intelligence. Here are 6 good reads to explore what spatial intelligence is and how it's evolving: 1. From Words to Worlds: Spatial Intelligence is AI’s Next Frontier by Fei-Fei Li → https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence Fei-Fei Li, the godmother of AI, is a key figure in spatial intelligence, since her work in computer vision, especially ImageNet, helped AI learn to recognize and understand objects in space. She's recently started a blog, and this post, in particular, argues that true intelligence requires grounding in space, understanding geometry, motion and...</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/693757616060963</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Reference: *Atlas of Structured Intelligence*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/443085216876424</link><description>✅ New Reference: *Atlas of Structured Intelligence* Title: 🗺️ Atlas of Structured Intelligence 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/atlas-of-structured-intelligence --- Summary: Across 40+ articles, PoCs (education, computing, space), specs, and the Cosmic Intelligence Model, this *Atlas* is the navigation layer: it locates each piece, shows recurring protocols, and connects micro (cognition) → meso (institutions) → macro (civilization) → cosmic (CIM). *It’s the map of the series itself, not a new theory.* &gt; From fragments to framework — &gt; *the Atlas turns a library into a system.* --- Why It Matters: • Gives newcomers a clear entry path; gives experts cross-links and dependencies • Reveals protocol reuse across domains (not just “themes,” but shared machinery) • Bridges qualitative ideas with quantitative indices and evaluation --- What’s Inside: • *Macro Map:* Core theory → applied domains → PoC suite → cosmic series • *Protocol Matrix:* Where jump-generator, memory-loop,...</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:36:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/443085216876424</guid></item></channel></rss>
