Just finished training my multimodal model on the full LLaVA-Instruct-150K dataset (157K samples) and wanted to share the results! 🔧 What I Built: A vision-language model that can understand images and answer questions about them, combining: - Google Gemma-3-270M (language) - OpenAI CLIP ViT-Large/14 (vision) - LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency 📊 Training Stats: - 157,712 training samples (full LLaVA dataset) - 3 epochs on A100 40GB - ~9 hours training time - Final loss: 1.333 training / 1.430 validation - Only 18.6M trainable params (3.4% of 539M total) 📈 sagar007/multigemma Benchmark Results: - VQA Accuracy: 53.8% - Works great for: animal detection, room identification, scene understanding 🔗 **Try it yourself:** - 🤗 Model: sagar007/multigemma - 🎮 Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagar007/Multimodal-Gemma - 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/sagar431/multimodal-gemma-270m Built with PyTorch Lightning + MLflow...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:50:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sagar007/387080486731099</guid></item><item><title>So, Koreans are also doing great progress behind Chinese,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/869541950904709</link><description>So, Koreans are also doing great progress behind Chinese, Their two open source ai models that are actually good in coding. upstage/Solar-Open-100B skt/A.X-K1 See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:50:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Ujjwal-Tyagi/869541950904709</guid></item><item><title>VividFlow: Complete AI Image Transformation Platform 🎬🎨✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/976121143006478</link><description>VividFlow: Complete AI Image Transformation Platform 🎬🎨✨ Three powerful creative tools in one streamlined workspace. VividFlow combines professional video generation, intelligent background replacement, and artistic style transfer to transform your images with precision and creativity. 🎭 Triple Creative Powers - Cinematic Video Generation transforms static images into smooth motion sequences from 0.5 to 5 seconds. Eight curated motion categories cover portraits, products, landscapes, and artistic content with precision-tuned templates. - Intelligent Background Replacement generates photorealistic scenes from 24 professionally crafted presets spanning studios, natural environments, urban settings, and seasonal atmospheres. Advanced edge refinement handles complex subjects, while the built-in Touch Up tool eliminates artifacts through AI-powered inpainting for flawless results. - Artistic Style Transfer converts photographs into stunning interpretations across six distinct styles...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:50:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/976121143006478</guid></item><item><title>Compared Quality and Speed Difference (with CUDA 13 &amp; Sage Attention) of BF16 vs GGUF Q8 vs FP8 Scaled vs NVFP4 for Z Image Turbo, FLUX Dev, FLUX SRPO, FLUX Kontext, FLUX 2 - Full 4K step by step tutorial also published</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/425042812655046</link><description>Compared Quality and Speed Difference (with CUDA 13 &amp; Sage Attention) of BF16 vs GGUF Q8 vs FP8 Scaled vs NVFP4 for Z Image Turbo, FLUX Dev, FLUX SRPO, FLUX Kontext, FLUX 2 - Full 4K step by step tutorial also published Full 4K tutorial : https://youtu.be/XDzspWgnzxI Check above full 4K tutorial to learn more and see uncompressed original quality and size images It was always wondered how much quality and speed difference exists between BF16, GGUF, FP8 Scaled and NVFP4 precisions. In this tutorial I have compared all these precision and quantization variants for both speed and quality. The results are pretty surprising. Moreover, we have developed and published NVFP4 model quant generator app and FP8 Scaled quant generator apps. The links of the apps are below if you want to use them. Furthermore, upgrading ComfyUI to CUDA 13 with properly compiled libraries is now very much recommended. We have observed some noticeable performance gains with CUDA 13. So for both SwarmUI and ComfyUI...</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:50:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/425042812655046</guid></item><item><title>😎 My new personal website is live!

Mox-Tiny-1 is finetuned from Llama's 3.1 8B architecture specifically for thinking partnership and high-fidelity AI interaction. Training domains were carefully selected with this goal in mind, and all datasets used were synthetically generated for the Mox-1 models specifically. Domains include but not limited to: - Direct opinions (clear stances on various topics) - Constructive disagreement (Pushing back on flawed premises) - Epistemic confidence (calibrated certainty and uncertainty) - Warmth &amp; presence (Empathetic, human responses) - Wonder &amp; puzzlement (Intellectual curiosity) Interaction Examples: Direct opinions: User: What 's the best programming language? Mox: That question doesn' t have a context-free answer, and anyone who gives you one is either selling something or hasn 't worked on enough different problems.

Not as easy as i expected, but I'm happy i was still able to have it working within a few hours after the original model was released! Interested in feedback if anyone wants to try it out! marksverdhei/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8 Note: If my PR to vLLM isn't merged yet you might have to use my fork.
