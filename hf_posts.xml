PlaiTO is designed to go beyond surface-level text generation, emphasizing structured reasoning, conceptual clarity, and analytical depth—especially in domains centered on human behavior and social systems. 🎯 Focus Areas Psychology Management &amp; Organizational Studies Sociology 📊 MMLU Benchmark Results (100 samples per domain) Professional Psychology: 76% Management: 74% Sociology: 75% These results highlight PlaiTO’s strong performance in abstract, theory-heavy, and reasoning-driven tasks. 💡 Why PlaiTO? Strong analytical and reasoning capabilities Better handling of complex human-centered problems Suitable for academic, educational, and research use cases Balanced performance across multiple humanities disciplines PlaiTO is ideal for conceptual analysis, case reasoning, academic discussion, and decision-support scenarios—while still requiring...</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:59:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/alibidaran/992533889532684</guid></item><item><title>A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</link><description>A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers. The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, "Whispered Tuning", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. 🔗 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:59:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Qwen-Image-Edit-3D-Lighting-Control app, featuring 8× horizontal and 3× elevational lighting positions for precise 3D lighting control.

At AIPrep, we are fixing this "watch and forget" cycle by building a foundational Generative Explanatory Model (GEM). GEM doesn't just give you a video or a wall of text; it builds an interactive lesson that asks you questions, catches your mistakes in real time, and adapts to your pace. We have just finished preparing our specialized datasets for this interactive logic, and you can already check them out on our profile to see how we are structuring this step-by-step reasoning. Training for the foundational model starts very soon, so stay in touch because something revolutionary is coming to the world of AI education.

At just 0.9 billion parameters, it belongs to a new generation of lightweight AI systems proving that raw model size is no longer the only path to high performance. Despite its small footprint, GLM-OCR posts exceptionally strong results across major document benchmarks. It scores 94.6 on OmniDocBench, 94.0 on OCRBench, and an impressive 96.5 on UniMERNet for formula recognition—numbers that place it alongside, and in some cases ahead of, significantly larger specialized OCR models. The takeaway is clear: efficiency is rapidly becoming a defining feature of modern AI design. Developed by Z.ai, a research group focused on advancing multimodal foundation models, GLM-OCR reflects a broader shift toward highly optimized architectures that deliver serious capability without requiring massive compute...</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:59:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Javedalam/705319100384927</guid></item><item><title>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/imnotkitty/790273915312125</link><description>The 2025 Chinese LLM Showdown: Western Models Still Dominate Top 4, but China Leads the Open-Source Arena. 🏆 The Champions: Claude-Opus-4.5, Gemini-3-Pro, GPT-5.2, and Gemini-3-Flash sweep the top four spots. 🚀 The Pursuers: Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.2 tie for first place among Chinese models; GLM-4.7, ERNIE-5.0, and Kimi secure their positions in the domestic top five. 🔥 The Biggest Highlight: The top three spots on the open-source leaderboard are entirely held by Team China (DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), outperforming the best western open-source models.
