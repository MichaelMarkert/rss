Given omni-modal (i.e., textual, visual and speech) inputs, EMOVA can generate both textual and speech responses with vivid emotional controls by utilizing the speech decoder and a style controller. ‚ú® EMOVA Highlights ‚úÖ State-of-the-art omni-modality: EMOVA achieves SoTA comparable results on both vision-language and speech benchmarks simultaneously. ‚úÖ Device adaptation: our codebase supports training/inference on both NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., A800 &amp; H20) and Ascend NPUs (e.g., 910B3)! ‚úÖ Modular design: we integrate multiple implementations of vision encoder, vision projector, and language model, even including the most recent DeepSeekMoE-tiny! üî• You are all welcome to try and star! - Project page: https://emova-...</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:24:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/KaiChen1998/260621109030490</guid></item><item><title>15 types of attention mechanisms</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/624548696865407</link><description>15 types of attention mechanisms Attention mechanisms allow models to dynamically focus on specific parts of their input when performing tasks. In our recent article, we discussed Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in detail and now it's time to summarize other existing types of attention. Here is a list of 15 types of attention mechanisms used in AI models: 1. Soft attention (Deterministic attention) -&gt; Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (1409.0473) Assigns a continuous weight distribution over all parts of the input. It produces a weighted sum of the input using attention weights that sum to 1. 2. Hard attention (Stochastic attention) -&gt; Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (1508.04025) Makes a discrete selection of some part of the input to focus on at each step, rather than attending to everything. 3. Self-attention -&gt; Attention Is All You Need (1706.03762) Each element in the sequence "looks" at other elements and...</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:24:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/624548696865407</guid></item><item><title>Hello community,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hanzla/186651630886849</link><description>Hello community, I want to share my work of creating a reasoning mamba model I used GRPO over Falcon3 Mamba Instruct to make this model.
