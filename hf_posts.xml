This field is evolving quickly, moving far beyond classics like PPO and GRPO. So here is our overview of 10 newest PO methods: 1. Pref-GRPO ‚Üí Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning (2508.20751) Stabilizes text-to-image reinforcement learning (RL) with pairwise preference rewards and a unified UNIGENBENCH benchmark 2. PVPO (Policy with Value Preference Optimization) ‚Üí PVPO: Pre-Estimated Value-Based Policy Optimization for Agentic Reasoning (2508.21104) This critic-free RL method uses a pre-trained model as a reference anchor to reduce bias and guide learning, selecting high-value examples through data pre-sampling 3. DCPO (Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization) ‚Üí DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (2509.02333) Uses dynamic clipping,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 05:21:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/304021452230579</guid></item><item><title>Hello everyone</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/andywu-kby/346535541829962</link><description>Hello everyone Good day!

One of the most requested models I've seen, The Johns Hopkins University's CLSP has trained state-of-the-art massively multilingual encoders using the ModernBERT architecture: mmBERT. Model details: - 2 model sizes: - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base - Uses the ModernBERT architecture, but with the Gemma2 multilingual tokenizer (so: flash attention, alternating global/local attention, unpadding/sequence packing, etc.) - Maximum sequence length of 8192 tokens, on the high end for encoders - Trained on 1833 languages using DCLM, FineWeb2, and many more sources - 3 training phases: 2.3T tokens pretraining on 60 languages, 600B tokens mid-training on 110 languages, and 100B tokens decay training on all 1833 languages. - Both models are MIT Licensed, and the full datasets and intermediary checkpoints are also publicly released Evaluation details: - Very competitive with ModernBERT at equivalent sizes on English (GLUE, MTEB v2 English after...</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 05:21:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/906557413568289</guid></item><item><title>upgrade your transformers üî•</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/916342597592275</link><description>upgrade your transformers üî• it comes with insanely capable models like merve/sam2-66ac9deac6fca3bc5482fe30 , microsoft/kosmos-2.5 , and more ü´° I built a notebook you can run with free Colab T4 to walk through the API for new models üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è merve/smol-vision fine-tuning will follow-up soon!
