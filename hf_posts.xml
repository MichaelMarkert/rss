Three is always better than one! 3x AMD Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 384GB RAM 24TB of RAID storage Ubuntu 24.04 ROCm 7.0.2 llama cpp, vLLM and Aibrix Small, cheap GPUs are about to become the Raspberry Pi of edge AI inference. Sprinkle some kubectl fairy dust on top, and suddenly it's a high-availability, self-healing, cloud-native, enterprise-grade AI cluster camping in a closet. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; itâ€™s aligned with the company that owns it.

Details: Today, the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab is transferring the project to Hugging Face. Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility. Read our full announcement for more details and quotes from UKP and Hugging Face leadership: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf We see an increasing wish from companies to move from large LLM APIs to local models for better control and privacy, reflected in the library's growth: in just the last 30 days, Sentence Transformer models have been downloaded &gt;270...</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 17:18:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/527498981313495</guid></item><item><title>We've built over 10K containerized reproductions of papers from arXiv!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/787120125285076</link><description>We've built over 10K containerized reproductions of papers from arXiv! Instead of spending all day trying to build an environment to test that new idea, just pull the Docker container from the Remyx registry. And with Remyx, you can start experimenting faster by generating a test PR in your codebase based on the ideas found in your paper of choice.

Here who is gaining the most: SelmaNajih001/InvestmentStrategyBasedOnSentiment The Space uses titles from this dataset: ðŸ“Š SelmaNajih001/Cnbc_MultiCompany Given a news title, it calculates a sentiment score : if the score crosses a certain threshold, the strategy decides to buy or sell. Each trade lasts one day, and the strategy then computes the daily return. For Tesla the best model seems to be the regression ðŸ‘€ Just a quick note: the model uses the closing price as the buy price, meaning it already reflects the impact of the news.
