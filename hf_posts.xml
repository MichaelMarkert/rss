It’s no longer just about "predicting the next token"—it’s about executing latent plans on a high-speed data highway. What happens when we combine DeepSeek’s stability with Google’s strategic intelligence? 1️⃣ The Infrastructure: DeepSeek’s mHC Moving from a single-lane residual stream to a multi-lane highway. Using the Birkhoff Polytope, mHC ensures mathematical stability (Identity Mapping) while routing specialized data through dedicated lanes. 2️⃣ The Intelligence: Google’s Meta-Controller An internal AI unit that lives inside the Transformer. It escapes the "Token Trap" by extracting data to create a latent plan, steering the model via Temporal Abstraction. The Synergy: In a Topological Transformer, the Meta-Controller finally has the "dedicated lanes" it needs to steer complex reasoning without causing gradient explosions. We aren't just making models bigger; we are...</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 09:38:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/406965796956131</guid></item><item><title>Happy New Year, Hugging Face!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/unmodeled-tyler/448164360090025</link><description>Happy New Year, Hugging Face! It's been a crazy year for me! This year I launched VANTA Research as a solo operator and managed to push out 14 original open source finetunes and 5 datasets in the span of about 4 months, completely on my own. The reception has been much higher than I ever anticipated and sincerely appreciate everyone that's checked out my work thus far. The good news is, I'm just getting started! In 2026 you can expect even more original models from VANTA Research, more open source datasets, and maybe some other cool things as well? 👀 2026 is gonna be big for AI in general, and I can't wait to experience it with all of you!

FORTY concurrent clients. That's 609 t/s out, 1492 t/s in. The model outputs fire faster than I can type, but feeds on data like a black hole on cheat day. But wait, there's more! Threw it into Claude Code torture testing with 60+ tools, 8 agents (7 sub-agents because apparently one wasn't enough chaos). It didn't even flinch. Extremely fast, scary good at coding. The kind of performance that makes you wonder if the model's been secretly reading Stack Overflow in its spare time lol 3 months ago, these numbers lived in my "maybe in “2030 dreams. Today it's running on my desk AND heaths my home office during the winter!

I've been busy working on some new ranking/position methodologies and excited to start sharing some results. Plot legends: - X = truncation rate (low = good) - ? = confusion rate (low = good) - blue bars = average completion tokens (low = good) - black diamonds = CI-banded performance (high = good) - cluster squares = models inside this group are equivalent openai/gpt-oss-120b remains the king in all dimensions of interest: truncation rates, completion lengths and performance. If I had but one complaint it's the reason_effort does not seem to actually work - more on this soon. Second is a 3-way tie in performance between the Qwen3-235B-2507 we all know and love with an unexpected entrant - ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct This is a very capable model and it's reasoning effort controls actually works, but you should absolutely not leave it on the default "unlimited" - enable a sensible limit (4k works well for 8k context length). Third place is another 3-way...</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 09:38:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mike-ravkine/983643024828039</guid></item><item><title>🚨 Ads might be coming to AI assistants.

The maximum load before failure was 630 g, at which point the Feetech STS3215 in joint 3 failed — its large brass output gear was completely worn down. The Feetech STS3250 in the base with a metal gear train withstood a significantly higher load.
