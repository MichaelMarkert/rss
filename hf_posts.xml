Approximately 17 hours ago, two new language models (LLMs) were registered under Samsung Electronics' official Hugging Face account. These models are: https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MuTokenZero2-32B https://huggingface.co/Samsung/MythoMax-L2-13B The model descriptions contain absurd and false claims, such as being trained on "1 million W200 GPUs," hardware that doesn't even exist. Moreover, community participants on Hugging Face who have noticed this issue are continuously posting that Samsung Electronics' account has been compromised. There is concern about potential secondary and tertiary damage if users download these LLMs released under the Samsung Electronics account, trusting Samsung's reputation without knowing about the hack. Samsung Electronics appears to be unaware of this situation, as they have not taken any visible...</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 17:18:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/seawolf2357/424129432408590</guid></item><item><title>🚀 ZeroGPU</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/cbensimon/356529804559377</link><description>🚀 ZeroGPU medium size is now available as a power-user feature Nothing too fancy for now—ZeroGPU Spaces still default to large (70GB VRAM)—but this paves the way for: - 💰 size-based quotas / pricing ( medium will offer significantly more usage than large ) - 🦣 the upcoming xlarge size (141GB VRAM) You can as of now control GPU size via a Space variable. Accepted values: - auto (future default) - medium - large (current default) The auto mode checks total CUDA tensor size during startup: - More than 30GB → large - Otherwise → medium See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 17:18:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/cbensimon/356529804559377</guid></item><item><title>🌟 Introducing Ilúvatar: Creative Design &amp; Invention AI 🌟</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/340514834154581</link><description>🌟 Introducing Ilúvatar: Creative Design &amp; Invention AI 🌟 Link: ginipick/IDEA-DESIGN Hello, AI creators! 👋 Today I'm introducing Ilúvatar, an amazing tool that automatically generates innovative design and invention ideas. ✨ Key Features 🧠 AI-Powered Idea Generation: Creates detailed design/invention ideas from simple prompts 🔍 Web Search Integration: Incorporates real-time information to reflect latest trends 📊 Kaggle Dataset Analysis: Provides data-driven insights 🖼️ Automatic Image Generation: Creates image prompts visualizing your ideas 📁 File Upload Support: Analyzes reference materials (text, CSV, PDF) 📈 Business Frameworks: Includes SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, BCG Matrix analyses 🌏 Multilingual Support: Available in both English and Korean 🎯 Perfect For 💼 Product Designers/Developers: When you need fresh product concepts 🔬 Researchers/Inventors: When you need innovative idea inspiration 📝 Planners/Marketers: When you need differentiated business strategies 🎓 Students/Educators:...</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 17:18:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/340514834154581</guid></item><item><title>We're thrilled to announce the launch of our comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) Course!

Fully automated, now live on Spotify. I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don’t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you’re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It’s not perfect yet — I’ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it’s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community — submit a PR or send feedback. It’s just a beta of an experimental idea!

Our work focused on 1) curating and evaluating culturally relevant African vision dataset then 2) Fine-tuning the Aya vision model to support underrepresented languages in Africa. I represented my beloved Sierra Leone with the Krio language. Krio is a beautiful first language spoken by a majority of our population. It was a humbling and inspiring experience to have it recognized, thanks to the relentless effort of everyone on the team. Special thanks to BK for offering me this opportunity 🫡 and to Cohere AI for such an amazing global research expedition🙏 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 17:18:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/582641914930631</guid></item></channel></rss>
