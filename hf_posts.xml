I recommend fine-tuning them to power your next edge application. We already provide Colab notebooks to guide you.

This architecture enables agents to: ‚Ä¢ Integrate memory, ethics, reasoning, and identity across layers ‚Ä¢ Select and execute reasoning jumps with traceable structure ‚Ä¢ Coordinate failure recovery and adaptive learning ‚Ä¢ Maintain cross-session identity and self-editing capability It‚Äôs not modular stacking.
