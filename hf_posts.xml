So I spent some time to do a researching which platform I could buy or build. My requirements ware: - Limited budget - Power supply 1 kW or higher - Few PCIe slots to be able to install more than one gpu - Zero maintenance cost, I don't want spend a lot of time or money to maintain lab hardware, except for the GPUs I chose the Intel Mac Pro 7.1: - Prices on eBay acceptable - Excelent cooling - 1.4 kW power supply - 7 PCIe slots - Zero maintenance: I don't need to do anything with the Mac Pro hardware; it just works - Classic UEFI boot loader It requires a bit of OS preparation: 1. Install Ubuntu 24.04 (it works with the general PC ISO image) 2. Set up T2 drivers sudo apt install -y dkms linux-headers-$( uname -r) applesmc-t2 apple-bce lm-sensors 3. Install t2fanrd to manually manage fans...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 14:06:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kostakoff/584269728210158</guid></item><item><title>You can now run MiniMax-2.5 locally! 🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/danielhanchen/750340203924335</link><description>You can now run MiniMax-2.5 locally! 🚀 At 230B parameters, MiniMax-2.5 is the strongest LLM under 700B params, delivering SOTA agentic coding &amp; chat.

Today, they are hallucinating beautifully. 10 years ago, getting an LSTM to output coherent English was a struggle. 10 years later, after a "cure" based on FineWeb-EDU and a custom synthetic mix for causal conversation, the results are fascinating. We trained this on ~10B tokens on a single AMD GPU (ROCm). It is not a Transformer: Echo-DSRN (400M) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by Hymba, RWKV, and xLSTM, designed to challenge the "Attention is All You Need" monopoly on the Edge. The ambitious goal is to build a small instruct model with RAG and tool usage capabilities ( ethicalabs/Kurtis-EON1 ) 📊 The Benchmarks (Size: 400M) For a model this size (trained on &lt;10B tokens), the specialized performance is surprising: *SciQ*: 73.8% 🦄 (This rivals billion-parameter models in pure fact retrieval). *PIQA*: 62.3% (Solid physical intuition for a sub-1B model). The Reality Check: HellaSwag (29.3%) and Winogrande (50.2%) show the limits of 400M...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 14:06:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/555686632418762</guid></item><item><title>While doing various projects I kept running into situations where I wanted to be able to have representative samples of some of the current large SOTA datasets that were smaller so I didn't need to worry about slicing or anything else at runtime.

Trained on CommonVoice 16.1 Dutch with 5 corruption strategies, this model catches mispronunciations, timing errors, and prosody issues in synthetic data that sentence-level embeddings miss entirely. Resources - Dutch model: yuriyvnv/WAVe-1B-Multimodal-NL - Portuguese model: yuriyvnv/WAVe-1B-Multimodal-PT - Code: https://github.com/yuriyvnv/WAVe This model builds on CommonVoice Dutch data — thanks to @ mozilla and the CommonVoice community for making multilingual speech data accessible. Would be great to hear from the Dutch NLP community — @ BramVanroy @ GroNLP — especially if you're working on Dutch ASR or TTS pipelines where quality filtering...</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 14:06:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yuriyvnv/654373931030541</guid></item></channel></rss>
