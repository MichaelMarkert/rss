Fully automated, now live on Spotify. I built this prototype to help keep up with the rapid pace of AI developments and, hopefully, make cutting-edge research more accessible. I don’t know about you, but just listening to a conversation about a paper really helps the content sink in for me. This build taught me a lot about full automation. If you’re into the technical weeds: Qwen3 runs on Inference to handle the script, Kokoro does the voice, and the whole thing gets published automatically thanks to the Hugging Face Jobs API and Gradio deployment. It’s not perfect yet — I’ll be monitoring for hallucinations and incoherence. The voice model still needs polish, but it’s a promising start. Would love to build this with the community — submit a PR or send feedback. It’s just a beta of an experimental idea! Big kudos to @ m-ric , whose Open NotebookLM this is based on, and to @ nielsr for his...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:32:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/617387724043904</guid></item><item><title>Lumier – Run macOS &amp; Linux VMs in a Docker</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/dhruv3006/465197265329383</link><description>Lumier – Run macOS &amp; Linux VMs in a Docker Lumier is an open-source tool for running macOS virtual machines in Docker containers on Apple Silicon Macs. When building virtualized environments for AI agents, we needed a reliable way to package and distribute macOS VMs. Inspired by projects like dockur/macos that made macOS running in Docker possible, we wanted to create something similar but optimized for Apple Silicon. The existing solutions either didn't support M-series chips or relied on KVM/Intel emulation, which was slow and cumbersome. We realized we could leverage Apple's Virtualization Framework to create a much better experience. Lumier takes a different approach: It uses Docker as a delivery mechanism (not for isolation) and connects to a lightweight virtualization service (lume) running on your Mac. Lumier is 100% open-source under MIT license and part of C/ua.

Recent RL paradigms often relied on a set of questions an answers that needs to be manually curated. Researchers from Tsinghua University went like "why though". 🤔 Indeed, why learn from question designed by a human teacher, when the model can start from their base knowledge and learn by experimenting in a code environment, proposing coding tasks themselves and trying to solve them? Thus they created “Absolute Zero Reasoning” (AZR), an approach that removes any need for human curated data. 🎭 𝗗𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀: ‣ Proposer: Generates challenging but solvable coding tasks ‣ Solver: Attempts to solve those self-proposed tasks 🧪 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀: all types are defined as triplets of program, input and output ‣ Deduction: Give model an input and program, it must deduce the output ‣ Abduction: Give model an program and output, it must find the input that gave said output ‣ Induction: Synthesize a...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:32:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/402808163323191</guid></item><item><title>Introducing bitnet-r1-llama-8b and bitnet-r1-qwen-32b preview!

These models are the first successful sub 1-billion-token finetune to BitNet architecture. We discovered that by adding an aditional input RMSNorm to each linear, you can finetune directly to BitNet with fast convergence to original model performance! We are working on a pull request to use this extra RMS for any model. To test these models now, install this fork of transformers: pip install git+https://github.com /Codys12/ transformers.git Then load the models and test: from transformers import ( AutoModelForCausalLM , AutoTokenizer ) model_id = "codys12/bitnet-r1-qwen-32b" model = AutoModelForCausalLM .from_pretrained( model_id, device_map= "cuda" , ) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer .from_pretrained(model_id, padding_side= "left" ) bitnet-r1-llama-8b and bitnet-r1-llama-32b were trained on ~ 300M and 200M tokens of the open-thoughts/OpenThoughts-114k dataset respectively, and were still significantly improving at the end of...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:32:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/codys12/705081891087680</guid></item><item><title>60+ Generative AI projects for your resume. grind this GitHub repo if you want to level up:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/190820854172664</link><description>60+ Generative AI projects for your resume. grind this GitHub repo if you want to level up: &gt; LLM fine-tuning and applications &gt; advanced RAG apps &gt; Agentic AI projects &gt; MCP and A2A (new) GitHub: https://github.com/aishwaryanr/awesome-generative-ai-guide/blob/main/resources/60_ai_projects.md See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:32:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hesamation/190820854172664</guid></item></channel></rss>
