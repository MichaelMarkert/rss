The model I've used ( https://lnkd.in/gx6J7YuB ) is about 140GB so could not fit either of the GPU.

Key findings from our research on optimal architectures for small language models: → Depth beats width: 32 layers outperforms 12 layers at the same parameter count → Best-in-class factuality: 47.5% on TruthfulQA → 10x training efficiency using WSD (Warmup-Stable-Decay) conversion → Canon layers add only 0.13% parameters but improve reasoning We trained on 1B tokens using the optimal 50-30-20 dataset mix (PDFs + filtered web + educational content), then converted to diffusion with just 100M additional tokens.

A new paper reports it's possible. The "Attractive Metadata Attack" paper details this stealthy new threat. To measure the real-world impact of their attack, the researchers needed a source of sensitive data for the agent to leak. We're proud that the AI4Privacy corpus was used to create the synthetic user profiles containing standardized PII for their experiments. This is a perfect win-win. Our open-source data helped researchers Kanghua Mo, 龙昱丞, Zhihao Li from Guangzhou University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to not just demonstrate a new attack, but also quantify its potential for harm. This data-driven evidence is what pushes the community to build better, execution-level defenses for AI agents. 🔗 Check out their paper to see how easily an agent's trust in tool metadata could be exploited: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110 #OpenSource #DataPrivacy #LLM #Anonymization...</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:22:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/284489022074040</guid></item><item><title>Introducing the Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-LoRAs-Fast demo, featuring image property comparison and contrast, built on top of Gradio and the combined Rerun SDK.

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

As it stands, the system is growing rapidly in one direction, and timm brings a whole lot to the table in another rapid-prototyping direction. Therefore, timm is now a core component for ease-of-use. BaseUtil is a new core component; aka src.geofractal.router.base_util inherits BaseComponent's behavior, so it should allow device movement for util operations which will direct utilization for device-to-device behavior for the upcoming accelerate integration. I'm trying to mitigate the base component structure as much as possible, but the need to chain components in specific orders presented a unique problem. By compartmentalizing utils into structures that can be delegated and moved, these structures can be repurposed, expanded autonomously, reduced autonomously, and more. ChainComponent inherits a subsystem specifically designed to organize multi-system multi-device formulas...</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:22:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AbstractPhil/257242713648796</guid></item><item><title>Hey everyone!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Parveshiiii/283996096084237</link><description>Hey everyone!

The next year is going to be a year of context engineering which expands beyond prompt engineering. The two complement each other: prompt engineering shapes how we ask, while context engineering shapes what the model knows, sees, and can do. To keep things clear, here are the main techniques and design patterns in both areas, with some useful resources for further exploration: ▪️ 9 Prompt Engineering Techniques (configuring input text) 1. Zero-shot prompting – giving a single instruction without examples. Relies entirely on pretrained knowledge. 2. Few-shot prompting – adding input–output examples to encourage model to show the desired behavior. ⟶ https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 3.
