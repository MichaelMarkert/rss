It’s no longer just about "predicting the next token"—it’s about executing latent plans on a high-speed data highway. What happens when we combine DeepSeek’s stability with Google’s strategic intelligence? 1️⃣ The Infrastructure: DeepSeek’s mHC Moving from a single-lane residual stream to a multi-lane highway. Using the Birkhoff Polytope, mHC ensures mathematical stability (Identity Mapping) while routing specialized data through dedicated lanes. 2️⃣ The Intelligence: Google’s Meta-Controller An internal AI unit that lives inside the Transformer. It escapes the "Token Trap" by extracting data to create a latent plan, steering the model via Temporal Abstraction. The Synergy: In a Topological Transformer, the Meta-Controller finally has the "dedicated lanes" it needs to steer complex reasoning without causing gradient explosions. We aren't just making models bigger; we are...</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/406965796956131</guid></item><item><title>2025.1  - DeepSeek entered the scene, backed by High Flyer Quant</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/447609737740306</link><description>2025.1 - DeepSeek entered the scene, backed by High Flyer Quant 2026.1 - IQuest enters the game, backed by Uniquant Quant 📈 and launching IQuest-Coder on huggingface https://huggingface.co/collections/IQuestLab/iquest-coder ✨ 40B models: Instruct / Thinking / Loop ✨ Loop = MoE-level performance with only ~5% extra training cost ✨ Native 128K context See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/447609737740306</guid></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2026</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Reubencf/286862187076146</link><description>Happy New Year 2026 i have planned to build many things this year , most of them will be cheaper or free alternative's to paid products i am looking forward to release some useful spaces ✌️ Stay Tuned !

I built a Deep Research multi-agent system using NVIDIA’s Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B model and CrewAI. Try it out yourself 👇 🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rakshit2020/Deep-Research-Agent-using-CrewAI What truly made this system feel next-level was powering it with NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B, its built for real-world agentic applications. The agentic system I built: 1. First talks to you and clarifies what you actually want, removing ambiguity 2. Then creates a proper research plan based on that clarity 3. Performs deep research using web search and content extraction tools 4. Finally produces a well-structured research report grounded in sources See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/RakshitAralimatti/360718325875789</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Article: *Operating an SI-Core (v0.1)*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/128065561044409</link><description>✅ New Article: *Operating an SI-Core (v0.1)* Title: 🛠️ Operating SI-Core: Dashboards, Playbooks, and Human Loops 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/operating-si-core --- Summary: Designing an SI-Core is only half the job — the other half is *running it safely at 03:00*.

They claim this is the year of recursive language models (I hope so). As models get bigger and better managing their context windows to fit longer prompts has been a standing engineering problem. They propose an inference technique that allows the model to externally crunch down long prompts into snippets that it can recursively call itself on, instead of directly feeding the entire prompt into the transformer. This could make models cheaper and more efficient but I doubt if big tech will adopt it since they profit more with the current approach (bigger models = longer context windows = more expensive the model). Once again such work came from academia/oss community cuz I doubt big tech would have shared these findings lol. They probably have much better inference methods that we may never know of haha.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Jaward/308052401069450</link><description>Incredible work!!

FORTY concurrent clients. That's 609 t/s out, 1492 t/s in. The model outputs fire faster than I can type, but feeds on data like a black hole on cheat day. But wait, there's more! Threw it into Claude Code torture testing with 60+ tools, 8 agents (7 sub-agents because apparently one wasn't enough chaos). It didn't even flinch. Extremely fast, scary good at coding. The kind of performance that makes you wonder if the model's been secretly reading Stack Overflow in its spare time lol 3 months ago, these numbers lived in my "maybe in “2030 dreams. Today it's running on my desk AND heaths my home office during the winter!

I've been working on getting vLLM to run natively on the new DGX Spark with its GB10 Blackwell GPU (SM121 architecture). The results? 2.5x faster inference compared to llama.cpp! 📊 Performance Highlights: • Qwen3-Coder-30B: 44 tok/s (vs 21 tok/s with llama.cpp) • Qwen3-Next-80B: 45 tok/s (vs 18 tok/s with llama.cpp) 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved: • Built PyTorch nightly with CUDA 13.1 + SM121 support • Patched vLLM for Blackwell architecture • Created custom MoE expert configs for GB10 • Implemented TRITON_ATTN backend workaround 📦 Available now: • Docker Hub: docker pull hellohal2064/vllm-dgx-spark-gb10:latest • HuggingFace: huggingface.co/Hellohal2064/vllm-dgx-spark-gb10 The DGX Spark's 119GB unified memory opens up possibilities for running massive models locally. Happy to connect with others working on the DGX Spark Blackwell!
