We're trying to change this by releasing ChatUI-energy, the first interface where you see in real-time what energy your AI conversations consume. Great work from @ jdelavande powered by spaces &amp; TGI, available for a dozen of open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma and more. jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Should all chat interfaces have this? Just like ingredients have to be shown on products you buy, we need more transparency in AI for users!

MalayLM is also attractive for organizations wishing to preserve data privacy as it s efficiency allows it to run on a local machine. 🧠 MamayLM is trained on high-quality Ukrainian data and understands Ukrainian language, culture, and history. It is built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 9B model, but uses a number of new advances stemming from INSAIT’s experience in creating BgGPT, a Bulgarian LLM we released last year, now adopted nationwide and profiled several times by Google as a worldwide success case. 🤝 MamayLM is developed in a...</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 05:22:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hannayukhymenko/367157502110648</guid></item><item><title>Just crossed half a million public apps on Hugging Face.

Lastly, they also release a new benchmark again with self-supervision, they use an LLM to evaluate the detailed captions focusing on localization 👏 See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 05:22:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/merve/338904780470677</guid></item><item><title>New launch: See the energy use of chatbot conversations, in real time. =)</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/meg/994494979628937</link><description>New launch: See the energy use of chatbot conversations, in real time. =) jdelavande/chat-ui-energy Great work from @ JulienDelavande !
