It enables end-to-end document parsing with precise content extraction in markdown format, and it also generates a clean HTML representation of the document while preserving its logical structure. 🤗🔥 Additionally, I’ve integrated one of my recent works — prithivMLmods/Gliese-OCR-7B-Post1.0 — which also excels at document comprehension. ⭐ Space / App : prithivMLmods/Logics-Parsing-VLM 📄 Technical Report by the Logics Team, Alibaba Group : Logics-Parsing Technical Report (2509.19760) ⚡ Collections : prithivMLmods/multimodal-implementations-67c9982ea04b39f0608badb0 Other Pages: ➔ Multimodal VLMs - July'25 : prithivMLmods/multimodal-vlms-until-july25-688312e6b840e1e156f13027 ➔ Multimodal VLMs - Aug'25 : prithivMLmods/multimodal-vlms-aug25-68a56aac39fe8084f3c168bd ➔ VL caption — &lt; Sep 15 ’25 : prithivMLmods/vl-caption-sep-15-25-68c7f6d737985c63c13e2391 . . ....</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:18:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/704561076669428</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Qwen3-Omni for Marketing: A Game-Changer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Sri-Vigneshwar-DJ/891594547382960</link><description>🚀 Qwen3-Omni for Marketing: A Game-Changer Just wanted to share something exciting I've been exploring—Qwen3-Omni and how it's transforming marketing workflows. What makes it special? At Hawky.ai we are started experimenting with Qwen3 recently for Analysis and Optimization. Unlike traditional tools that look at text, images, or audio separately, Qwen3-Omni analyzes everything together. It handles 119 languages, processes 40-minute audio sequences, and understands both images and videos—all at once. The cool part? It's 2-3x faster than similar models thanks to its MoE architecture. Real applications I'm seeing: Ad Analysis: It scores video ads by combining visual elements, audio tone, and text—giving 25% better CTR predictions than single-mode tools. Campaign Localization: Drop in one ad, get 10 localized versions with native voiceovers in under a minute. Perfect for testing across markets. Market Research: Feed it competitor content, podcasts, or UGC videos. It extracts actionable...</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:18:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Sri-Vigneshwar-DJ/891594547382960</guid></item><item><title>Introducing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/SelmaNajih001/721687692996128</link><description>Introducing SelmaNajih001/StockPredictionExplanation , built with GRPO and RAG: -GRPO trains the model to predict and explain stock direction. -RAG grounds explanations in historical financial news and central bank speeches.

Probably, you have done it with minimising a KL divergence, and it somehow worked. Well, not that well, right? 1️⃣ Your model tends to memorise! 2️⃣ Your model might get the right answer, but its reasoning might be flawed. To fix those problems, we rethink distillation and process a new approach! A method that is based on constrained RL that comes with nice theoretical guarantees and excellent performance! Check it out: Rethinking Large Language Model Distillation: A Constrained Markov Decision Process Perspective (2509.22921) Let us do distillation right! Please upvote if you find it useful!

This PoC tests whether mission identity, ethics, and governance can endure across centuries of generational drift and uncertainty. A starship becomes more than transport: it is a *self-sustaining arc of civilization*. &gt; The challenge is not propulsion. &gt; *It is continuity of mind and mission.* --- Why It Matters: • Demonstrates structural continuity over simulated 500-year journeys • Validates conflict mediation and governance stability without collapse • Proves that ethics and identity can persist across generations --- What’s Inside: • Starship OS integrating resilience, ethics, and memory loops • Simulation of generational conflict, scarcity events, value...</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:18:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/107464223968156</guid></item></channel></rss>
