Here are some of the most popular model types that shape the vast world of AI (with examples in the brackets): 1. LLM - Large Language Model (GPT, LLaMA) -&gt; Large Language Models: A Survey (2402.06196) + history of LLMs: https://www.turingpost.com/t/The%20History%20of%20LLMs It's trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. They are mostly build on Transformer architecture, predicting the next token. LLMs scale by increasing overall parameter count across all components (layers, attention heads, MLPs, etc.) 2. SLM - Small Language Model (TinyLLaMA, Phi models, SmolLM) A Survey of Small Language Models (2410.20011) Lightweight LM optimized for efficiency, low memory use, fast inference, and edge use. SLMs work using the same principles as LLMs 3.

So we’ve made 2 notebook for abliterating any model in order to achieve a good model that will actually help you! The notebooks are made using @ mlabonne ‘s abliteration logic and datasets! Feel free to use them and happy training 😊 https://github.com/dralexlup/LLM-Abliteration See translation</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 17:21:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/drwlf/878228510592624</guid></item><item><title>Imagine you could have an Image Arena score equivalent at each checkpoint during training.

We released the first version of just that: Crowd-Eval Add one line of code to your training loop and you will have a new real human loss curve in your W&amp;B dashboard. Thousands of real humans from around the world rating your model in real time at the cost of a few dollars per checkpoint is a game changer. Check it out here: https://github.com/RapidataAI/crowd-eval First 5 people to put it in their loop get 100'000 human responses for free!
