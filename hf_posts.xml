My skepticism circuits overloaded, but my local AI FOMO module screamed louder. I've thrown this 33B monoblock LLM onto a single GPU and used Roo Code for some‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúvibe testing‚Äù. It‚Äôs terrifyingly competent. As an architect, it‚Äôs the best open-weight model I‚Äôve touched this side of 2025.

Key results: Qwen3-0.6B: 63.2 ‚Üí 66.0 on MATH-500 (+4%) Gemma3-1B: 41.0 ‚Üí 45.6 on MATH-500 (+11%) The method extracts coherent reasoning patterns from one model via Internal Coherence Maximization, converts them to DPO training data, and uses that to improve a completely different model architecture. This goes beyond the original ICM paper which only improved models using their own labels. We're showing you can transfer capabilities between any models - imagine extracting capabilities from strong models to improve your local ones.

They're gen AI systems that help models and agents learn internal representations of real-world environments. Today, we invite you to take a look at 12 standout examples: 1. WorldVLA ‚Üí WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model (2506.21539) This autoregressive world model integrates action prediction and visual world modeling in a single framework, allowing each to enhance the other. It introduces an attention masking strategy to reduce action prediction errors 2. SimuRA ‚Üí https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773 A generalized world model that uses a language-based world model to simulate and plan actions before execution, enabling more general and flexible reasoning 3.

It works by iterating over an existing HF dataset and by using a LLM to create completions. - Problem: You need a fast way to create custom datasets for fine-tuning or RAG, but you want the flexibility to use different LLM backends or your own infrastructure. - Solution: Completionist connects with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including Ollama and LM Studio, or a Hugging Face inference endpoint. A simple CLI like Completionist gives you the possibility to take full control of your synthetic data generation workflow. üëâ Check out Completionist on GitHub: https://github.com/ethicalabs-ai/completionist Synthetic Dataset Example: ethicalabs/kurtis-mental-health-v2-sft-reasoning See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 05:33:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mrs83/268112975581936</guid></item><item><title>üöÄ Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 Is Here</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/625756342268823</link><description>üöÄ Dhanishtha-2.0-preview-0825 Is Here The Intermediate Thinking Model just leveled up again.

It works offline, zero cloud, zero internet, zero EU AI Act anxiety. No limit with all tokens on the house. It‚Äôs not great, not terrible- adequate performance for an on device AI agent chewing through code on a 1.24 kg laptop. I wrote an interpreter to broker peace between Claude Code and my local AI runtime. Make sure you own your AI. AI in the cloud is not aligned with you; it‚Äôs aligned with the company that owns it.
