With FlashPack, loading any model can be 3–6× faster than with the current state-of-the-art methods like accelerate or the standard load_state_dict() and to() flow — all wrapped in a lightweight, pure-Python package that works anywhere.

The result is clearer, high-quality visualizations that enhance understanding of object localization, reasoning and multimodal alignment across models. 👥 Authors: Yi Li, Hualiang Wang, Xinpeng Ding, Haonan Wang, and Xiaomeng Li 📅 Conference: ICCV, 19 – 23 Oct, 2025 | Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA 🇺🇸 📄 Paper: Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs (2506.23270) 📁 Repository: https://github.com/xmed-lab/TAM 🚀 ICCV-2023-25-Papers: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers 🚀 Added to the Multi-Modal Learning Section: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/ICCV-2023-25-Papers/blob/main/sections/2025/main/multi-modal-learning.md 📚 More...</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:29:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/DmitryRyumin/275169930033420</guid></item><item><title>I’m just reading that Ryzen AI 395 has to be 30% slower than DGX Spark in LLM inferencing… and only 96GB GPU RAM… good I haven’t RTFM upfront, so I made the AMD faster with 128GB unified RAM 🫡</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/949505421454376</link><description>I’m just reading that Ryzen AI 395 has to be 30% slower than DGX Spark in LLM inferencing… and only 96GB GPU RAM… good I haven’t RTFM upfront, so I made the AMD faster with 128GB unified RAM 🫡 Z2 mini G1a can run Qwen3 Coder 30B BF16 at 26.8 tok/sec in ~60GB GPU RAM See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:29:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mitkox/949505421454376</guid></item><item><title>Spatial reasoning is a domain where LLMs struggle surprisingly hard.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/mike-ravkine/114687779852365</link><description>Spatial reasoning is a domain where LLMs struggle surprisingly hard. A new paper, "Stuck in the Matrix: Probing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models" compares performance on a handful of spacial reasoning tasks and finds all SOTA LLMs breaking down and hallucinating their faces off when the grids get large. https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20198v1 The word search task is especially revealing: notice the bias towards detecting "horizontal" while struggling with "vertical" - LLMs only understand simple, linear relationships.. add a stride for 2D and it's basically over.

But this provocative article provoked the community quite a bit. The case in point is Claude Code, which happens to be my biggest productivity revolution since ChatGPT. RAG predated TUI and agents. So to be fair it's quite an achievement to survive the AI evolution. But I feel it is overshadowed by context engineering in the agent era.
