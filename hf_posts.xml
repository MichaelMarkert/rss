Every language carries its own cultural values and worldviews. So, when we build AI systems, we're not just deciding how they speak but also whose perspectives they represent. Even choosing which dialect to train on in Norway becomes a question of inclusion and power. In Kenya, will AI speak Swahili from Nairobi or coastal regions? What about indigenous languages with rich oral traditions but limited written text, like Quechua in Peru or Cherokee in North America? The path forward? Building WITH communities, not just FOR them. Working with local partners (libraries, universities, civil society), testing for cultural alignment, and asking hard questions about representation. Just published some thoughts on this after my keynote in Norway a few weeks ago: https://huggingface.co/blog/giadap/when-ai-speaks See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 09:23:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/887797954746272</guid></item><item><title>ü§î Ready to build better AI models with synthetic data, but don't know where to start?

It latches onto a single line of thought and fails to produce a robust, well-rounded plan. This is a common struggle I've called the "AI Reasoning Paradox." To tackle this, I developed Trinity-Synthesis, a multi-agent architecture designed to force reflection and synthesis before delivering a final answer. The philosophy is simple: constructive conflict between different perspectives leads to better solutions. Here‚Äôs the core idea: Instead of one agent, it uses four agents running on the same base model but with different "personalities" defined by their system prompts and temperature settings: üß† The Visionary: Thinks outside the box (high temp: 1.0). üìä The Analyst: Focuses on logic, data, and structure (low temp: 0.3). üõ†Ô∏è The Pragmatist: Evaluates feasibility, costs, and risks (mid temp: 0.5). These three "thinkers" work in parallel on the...</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 09:23:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/brainhome/128948549150065</guid></item><item><title>The demo for smoldocling / nanonets ocr / typhoon ocr /  monkey ocr  explores the document OCR capabilities of various newly released multimodal VLMs in a single space.
