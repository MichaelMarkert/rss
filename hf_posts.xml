If you want to convert an existing Space, like this one hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS , so that you can use it with Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline / TinyAgents / or any LLM that supports MCP, here's all you need to do: 1. Duplicate the Space (in the Settings Tab) 2. Upgrade the Gradio sdk_version to 5.28 (in the README.md ) 3. Set mcp_server=True in launch() 4. (Optionally) add docstrings to the function so that the LLM knows how to use it, like this: def generate ( text, speed= 1 ): """ Convert text to speech audio. Parameters: text (str): The input text to be converted to speech. speed (float, optional): Playback speed of the generated speech. That's it! Now your LLM will be able to talk to you 🤯 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 05:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/810486848644944</guid></item><item><title>🎨 Renoir Studio: Impressionist Masterpieces Reborn Through AI ✨</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/692850049335646</link><description>🎨 Renoir Studio: Impressionist Masterpieces Reborn Through AI ✨ 🌟 Experience Renoir's Magical Brushstrokes with AI! 🔗 Try it now: ginigen/flux-lora-renoir 🔗 Model page: openfree/pierre-auguste-renoir 🔗 Collection: openfree/painting-art-ai-681453484ec15ef5978bbeb1 Hello, AI art enthusiasts! 💖 Today I'm introducing a special model - Pierre-Auguste Renoir Studio.

Over the past few months, I explored how to build intelligent, autonomous agents using cutting-edge tools like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. The course covered everything from the fundamentals of agents to advanced topics like fine-tuning for function-calling, observability, evaluation, and even agents in games. Some key content included: 1. Introduction to AI Agents 2. Agentic RAG use cases 3. Multi-framework implementation: smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph 4. Building, testing, and certifying a complete agent project This was a hands-on, practical experience that deepened my understanding of how to design reliable, tool-using LLM agents. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and beyond. Many thanks to the Hugging Face team for putting this together. Let’s build safe and useful agents!

VIDraft/phi-4-reasoning-plus 🌟 Key Highlights Compact Size (14B parameters): Efficient for use in environments with limited computing resources, yet powerful in performance. Extended Context (32k tokens): Capable of handling lengthy and complex input sequences. Enhanced Reasoning: Excels at multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematics, science, and coding challenges. Chain-of-Thought Methodology: Provides a detailed reasoning process, followed by concise, accurate summaries. 🏅 Benchmark Achievements Despite its smaller size, Phi-4-reasoning-plus has delivered impressive results, often surpassing significantly larger models: Mathematical Reasoning (AIME 2025): Achieved an accuracy of 78%, significantly outperforming larger models like DeepSeek-R1 Distilled (51.5%) and Claude-3.7 Sonnet (58.7%).

Just tested it with Steve Jobs' Stanford speech and was speechless (pun intended). The video isn’t sped up. 3 things that floored me: - Transcription took just 10 seconds for a 15-min file - Got a CSV with perfect timestamps, punctuation &amp; capitalization - Stunning accuracy (correctly captured "Reed College" and other specifics) NVIDIA also released a demo where you can click any transcribed segment to play it instantly. The improvement is significant: number 1 on the ASR Leaderboard, 6% error rate (best in class) with complete commercial freedom (cc-by-4.0 license). Time to update those Whisper pipelines!

Excited to share a new feature from the Gradio team along with a tutorial. If you don't already know, Gradio is an open-source Python library used to build interfaces for machine learning models. Beyond just creating UIs, Gradio also exposes API capabilities and now, Gradio apps can be launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for LLMs. If you already know how to use Gradio, there are only two additional things you need to do: * Add standard docstrings to your function (these will be used to generate the descriptions for your tools for the LLM) * Set mcp_server=True in launch() Here's a complete example (make sure you already have the latest version of Gradio installed): import gradio as gr def letter_counter ( word, letter ): """Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word. Args: word: The word or phrase to analyze letter: The letter to count occurrences of Returns: The number of times the letter appears in the word """ return...</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 05:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/767083410530735</guid></item><item><title>At</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/177281245715492</link><description>At xet-team we've been hard at work bringing a new generation of storage to the Hugging Face community, and we’ve crossed some major milestones: 👷 Over 2,000 builders and nearing 100 organizations with access to Xet 🚀 Over 70,000 model and dataset repositories are Xet-backed 🤯 1.4 petabytes managed by Xet As we move repos from LFS to Xet for everyone we onboard, we’re pushing our content-addressed store (CAS). Check out the chart below 👇 of CAS hitting up to 150 Gb/s throughput this past week. All of this growth is helping us build richer insights. We expanded our repo graph, which maps how Xet-backed repositories on the Hub share bytes with each other. Check out the current network in the image below (nodes are repositories, edges are where repos share bytes) and visit the space to see how different versions of Qwen, Llama, and Phi models are grouped together xet-team/repo-graph Join the waitlist to get access! https://huggingface.co/join/xet See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 05:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/jsulz/177281245715492</guid></item><item><title>One of the biggest challenges I've been facing since I started developing [𝐏𝐝𝐟𝐈𝐭𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧](</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/as-cle-bert/299436064475061</link><description>One of the biggest challenges I've been facing since I started developing [𝐏𝐝𝐟𝐈𝐭𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧]( https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown ) was handling correctly the conversion of files like Excel sheets and CSVs: table conversion was bad and messy, almost unusable for downstream tasks🫣 That's why today I'm excited to introduce 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬, the new feature of PdfItDown v1.4.0!🎉 With 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴, you can choose among three (for now👀) flavors of text extraction and conversion to PDF: - 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, which does a fantastic work with presentations, spreadsheets and word documents🦆 - 𝗟𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗮𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗲 by LlamaIndex, suitable for more complex and articulated documents, with mixture of texts, images and tables🦙 - 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗜𝘁𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻 by Microsoft, not the best at handling highly structured documents, by extremly flexible in terms of input file format (it can even convert XML, JSON and ZIP files!)✒️ You can use this new feature in your python scripts (check the attached code snippet!😉) and in the command line interface as well!🐍...</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 05:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/as-cle-bert/299436064475061</guid></item><item><title>Qwen 3 Fine tuning &gt;&gt; MoE.

Update the experiment thread to include config and script for fine-tuning the Qwen3-30B-A3B model. The goal is to make a low latency non-thinking model for a daily driver coding, so 3 billion parameters active should be perfect. ✔️ training running ✔️ evals running ⏭️ improve dataset The moe isn't going to fit into colab's A100 even with quantization (🙏 @ UnslothAI ). So I've been working on HF spaces' H100s for this. Everything is available in the tread and I'll share more tomorrow. burtenshaw/Qwen3-Code-Lite#1 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 05:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/395006544317053</guid></item></channel></rss>
