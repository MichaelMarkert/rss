And importantly, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to receive some knowledge and guidance from @ merve to build open-source demos and stuff. Thank you for the belief. Thank you ‚Äî much love.

For papers that include code, setting up the right environment often means hours of dependency hell and configuration debugging. At Remyx AI, we built an agent that automatically creates and tests Docker images for research papers, then shares them publicly so anyone can reproduce results with a single command. We just submitted PR #908 to integrate this directly into arXiv Labs. If you believe in making reproducible research accessible to everyone, give it a bump!: https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-browse/pull/908 See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 09:24:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/494327094243098</guid></item><item><title>We're kick-starting the process of Transformers v5, with</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/lysandre/194539610907979</link><description>We're kick-starting the process of Transformers v5, with @ ArthurZ and @ cyrilvallez ! v5 should be significant: we're using it as a milestone for performance optimizations, saner defaults, and a much cleaner code base worthy of 2025. Fun fact: v4.0.0-rc-1 came out on Nov 19, 2020, nearly five years ago!

We built hundreds of Docker images for arXiv papers with a codebase - it's tough to find what you're looking for unless you happen to have the arXiv id handy using DockerHub's search. So we added full text search over these resources so that you're that much closer to testing a new promising idea. More resources to be indexed soon!

TL;DR I‚Äôm going full John Connor on the AI content apocalypse Think of it as an on device AI ad-blocker, but for: Em-dash overdose. Seriously, why is everything suddenly revolutionary‚Äîdisruptive‚Äîlife-changing? AI influencers‚Äô auto-generated posts and images, auto-posted, all hands-free. Fake news, fake images, fake people... puff. Surprisingly, it works. I suppose it will block some human-generated content. However, I would rather read a 2007 Myspace blog than another ‚Äú10 Growth Hacks Powered By ChatGPT‚Äù post.

This work was part of a paper we published to ICCR Kyoto 2025. Check out or code here: https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot/tree/main Our work aims to solve two key problems in the world of robotic manipulation: 1. The lack of a well-developed, open-source, accessible teleoperation system that can work out of the box. 2. No performant end-to-end control, recording, and learning platform for robots that is completely hardware agnostic.
