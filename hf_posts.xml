We just dropped a blog covering them: - Kernels from the Hub - MXFP4 Quantization - Tensor &amp; Expert Parallelism - Dynamic Sliding Window &amp; Cache - Continuous Batching &amp; Paged Attention Grab a coffee &amp; dive in! ☕️ https://huggingface.co/blog/faster-transformers See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 05:19:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/sergiopaniego/319778709690075</guid></item><item><title>Most apps don't have great full-text search over their assets.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/salma-remyx/853424776483426</link><description>Most apps don't have great full-text search over their assets. We've developed an agent to automate the environment building and testing of experimental codebases sourced from arXiv. We push these containerized reproductions daily to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/remyxai However, searching for them can be challenging unless you know the specific arXiv ID associated with each paper. We are currently working on implementing a search feature in Remyx, which will make these assets easily discoverable and ready for testing 🔍 Stay tuned!

In this tutorial video, I will show you how to literally 1-click to install this model and our app on Windows (locally), Massed Compute (cloud) and RunPod (cloud). The images are all raw 2560x1440 pixels with 8-steps Refiner of Hunyuan Image 2.1 model This model native resolution is 2048x2048 pixels See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 05:19:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MonsterMMORPG/330916531424120</guid></item><item><title>🎉 Big congratulations to the winners of the "Synthetic 2 Real Object Detection Challenge 2", the second Kaggle challenge that Duality AI hosted.

One of the most requested models I've seen, The Johns Hopkins University's CLSP has trained state-of-the-art massively multilingual encoders using the ModernBERT architecture: mmBERT. Model details: - 2 model sizes: - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small - jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base - Uses the ModernBERT architecture, but with the Gemma2 multilingual tokenizer (so: flash attention, alternating global/local attention, unpadding/sequence packing, etc.) - Maximum sequence length of 8192 tokens, on the high end for encoders - Trained on 1833 languages using DCLM, FineWeb2, and many more sources - 3 training phases: 2.3T tokens pretraining on 60 languages, 600B tokens mid-training on 110 languages, and 100B tokens decay training on all 1833 languages. - Both models are MIT Licensed, and the full datasets and intermediary checkpoints are also publicly released Evaluation details: - Very competitive with ModernBERT at equivalent sizes on English (GLUE, MTEB v2 English after...</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 05:19:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tomaarsen/906557413568289</guid></item><item><title>🤝 Collaborating with AMD to ensure Hugging Face Transformers runs smoothly on AMD GPUs!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/845836724116614</link><description>🤝 Collaborating with AMD to ensure Hugging Face Transformers runs smoothly on AMD GPUs! We run daily CI on AMD MI325 to track the health of the most important model architectures and we’ve just made our internal dashboard public.
