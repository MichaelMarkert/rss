A few take-aways stood out - especially for those interested in local deployment and performance trade-offs: 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (via Fireworks API) tops the table at **83.66%** with ~55 tok/s. 2Ô∏è‚É£ But the **30B-A3B Unsloth** quant delivered **82.20%** while running locally at ~45 tok/s and with zero API spend. 3Ô∏è‚É£ The same Unsloth build is ~5x faster than Qwen's **Qwen3-32B**, which scores **82.20%** as well yet crawls at &lt;10 tok/s. 4Ô∏è‚É£ On Apple silicon, the **30B MLX** port hits **79.51%** while sustaining ~64 tok/s - arguably today's best speed/quality trade-off for Mac setups. 5Ô∏è‚É£ The **0.6B** micro-model races above 180 tok/s but tops out at **37.56%** - that's why it's not even on the graph (50 % performance cut-off). All local runs were done with LM Studio on an M4 MacBook Pro, using Qwen's official recommended settings....</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:24:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/wolfram/819510719695955</guid></item><item><title>VisionScout ‚Äî Now with Video Analysis! üöÄ</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/DawnC/287598166225995</link><description>VisionScout ‚Äî Now with Video Analysis! üöÄ I‚Äôm excited to announce a major update to VisionScout, my interactive vision tool that now supports VIDEO PROCESSING, in addition to powerful object detection and scene understanding! ‚≠êÔ∏è NEW: Video Analysis Is Here! üé¨ Upload any video file to detect and track objects using YOLOv8. ‚è±Ô∏è Customize processing intervals to balance speed and thoroughness. üìä Get comprehensive statistics and summaries showing object appearances across the entire video.

Turns out, it's not always about fancy tech upgrades, because sometimes it's just clever design. Our latest blog post at Hugging Face dives into how minimal design choices can completely transform how users experience AI. We've seen our community turn the same base models into everything from swimming coaches to interview prep specialists with surprisingly small tweaks. The most fascinating part? When we tested identical models with different "personalities" in our Inference Playground, the results were mind-blowing. Want to experiment yourself? Our Inference Playground lets anyone (yes, even non-coders!) test these differences in real-time. You can: - Compare multiple models side-by-side - Customize system prompts - Adjust parameters like temperature - Test multi-turn conversations It's fascinating how a few lines of instruction text can transform the same AI from strictly professional to...</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:24:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/315154856088110</guid></item><item><title>üî• We're thrilled to share some exciting news about ICEdit!

Currently, ICEdit app ( RiverZ/ICEdit ) has soared to the second place on the weekly trend list of Hugging Face Space, just trailing behind Qwen3. What's more, it also holds the second position on the overall space trend list. This achievement wouldn't have been possible without your incredible support and love. A huge thank you to each and every one of you‚ù§! üéâ The ICEdit community has been incredibly active, and we've seen a plethora of amazing ComfyUI workflows being shared. For instance, with the help of ComfyUI - nunchaku, you can run ICEdit locally with just 4GB of VRAM. This makes it much more accessible for those with limited hardware resources. üéá If you're interested in the detailed information, please head over to our repository. We highly encourage you to give these workflows a try and explore the creative possibilities that ICEdit offers.

Workflows are through predefined code paths, ensuring that each step is executed in a deterministic manner. Agents are like smart assistants that can think on their own. They understand situations, make decisions, and act, whatever the task is new or unpredictable. Think of the Agent as a chef who can make a meal based on what they have. Workflows are like a recipe with fixed steps. They‚Äôre a series of tasks done in order, like following a checklist for approving a loan. They‚Äôre great for tasks that don‚Äôt change much.
