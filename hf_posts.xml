In our new blog post with Dr. Sasha Luccioni, we argue that separating them (as is too often the case) means missing the bigger picture of how AI systems impact both people and the planet. Ethical and sustainable AI development can’t be pursued in isolation. The same choices that affect who benefits or is harmed by AI systems also determine how much energy and resources they consume. We explore how two key concepts, evaluation and transparency, can serve as bridges between these domains: 📊 Evaluation, by moving beyond accuracy or performance metrics to include environmental and social costs, as we’ve done with tools like the AI Energy Score. 🔍 Transparency, by enabling reproducibility, accountability, and environmental reporting through open tools like the Environmental Transparency Space. AI systems mirror our priorities. If we separate ethics from sustainability, we risk building technologies that are efficient but...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/giadap/452837154929545</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Article: *Envy — The Structural Law of Relative Evaluation*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/689097395708339</link><description>✅ New Article: *Envy — The Structural Law of Relative Evaluation* Title: 🧭 Envy, Comparison, and the Structural Law of Relative Evaluation: Why “They Got More” Hurts — and How Protocols Contain It 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/envy-structural-law-of-relative-evaluation --- Summary: Envy isn’t a moral glitch — it’s a *relative-evaluation loop*. When identity meets comparison, the mind computes *delta-to-others* (status, attention, resources). If that delta breaches a threshold without a repair path, the loop escalates into resentment. Structured Intelligence makes this computable — and containable. &gt; Envy compares levels. &gt; *Integrity compares trajectories.* --- Why It Matters: • Turns envy from shame into an *auditable signal* (where, when, and why comparison spikes) • Provides *de-escalation protocols* for individuals, teams, and platforms • Guides product/organization design to reduce perceived unfairness and burnout --- What’s Inside: • The Envy Loop: *trigger →...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/689097395708339</guid></item><item><title>🌊 Create Your Own Underwater World with iMini AI – No Invite, No Watermark!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Monica997/949496784214909</link><description>🌊 Create Your Own Underwater World with iMini AI – No Invite, No Watermark! Just tried something incredible on iMini AI — I used the nano banana model to generate a stunning underwater world image 🐠, then turned it into a dynamic video using the latest Sora 2 model. The result? It looks so real, like I actually filmed it while scuba diving! 🤿✨ The water ripples, the light rays, even the fish movement — all generated by AI in seconds. The best part? ✅ No invite code required ✅ No watermark ✅ Members can generate without using credits If you’re into AI visuals or creative video experiments, this one’s a must-try. 👉 Experience it now at https://imini.com/ See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Monica997/949496784214909</guid></item><item><title>🚀 No invite.

First it creates a circular loop and reflects the flaws present in the AI judges. Then, the perceived quality depends on the end user: an enterprise LLM appeals to professionals and business people, while a generic one appeals to laymen. The two have almost opposite criteria to assess the value. Finally, benchmarking metrics currently in use fail to capture many of the unique features of specialized LLMs, such as exhaustivity, or the quality of the relevancy and trustworthiness scores attached to each element in the response. In fact, besides xLLM, very few if any LLMs display such scores to the user. I now discuss these points, as well as the choice of test prompts, and preliminary results about xLLM, compared to others. -- Structured output vs standard response -- A peculiarity of xLLM is that if offers...</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/vincentg64/231735241059410</guid></item></channel></rss>
