Synopsis: "A man insults a sentient traffic light on the way to a meeting. Little does he know it is connected to a social media network for AI, and that his action will lead to a very bad day."

Key Advantages: - VRAM Maximization: Can generate high quality models sized exactly to fit hardware constraints (e.g., fitting the model into exactly 24GB VRAM). - Data-Driven Precision: Quantization mix is determined by actual weight error sensitivity rather than hardcoded rules, often yielding better PPL/KLD size trade-offs.

Real security is about layers.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</link><description>A single lock on a door isn't enough. Real security is about layers. The same is true for AI privacy. A new paper, "Whispered Tuning", offers a fantastic layered solution that aims to fortify LLMs against privacy infringements. We're proud that the first, essential layer, a high-precision PII redaction model was built on the foundation of the Ai4Privacy/pii-65k dataset. Our dataset provided the necessary training material for their initial anonymization step, which then enabled them to develop further innovations like differential privacy fine-tuning and output filtering. This is a win-win: our data helps create a solid base, and researchers build powerful, multi-stage privacy architectures on top of it. Together, we're making AI safer. 🔗 Read the full paper to see how a strong foundation enables a complete privacy solution: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130659 🚀 Stay updated on the latest in privacy-preserving AI—follow us on LinkedIn:...</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:50:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/MikeDoes/512575404125311</guid></item><item><title>📢 Who want's to have a quick start for adapting CoT schema for any LLM, this post would be relevant.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/337674723701292</link><description>📢 Who want's to have a quick start for adapting CoT schema for any LLM, this post would be relevant. Excited to share a new version of 🌟 bulk-chain 🌟! Bulk-chain is high-level wrapper over LLM providers for efficient quering LLMs hosted by third-party services. It brings native batching via support of async clients. 🌟 https://github.com/nicolay-r/bulk-chain/tree/master What's new: ☑️ Simplified inference setup The API is now closer to the OpenAI paradigm for toggling streaming. Instead of separate patterns in 1.2.0, now it is possible to simple toggles to enable streaming and async behavior. ☑️ 🛠️ Fixed issues when passing code contain {} blocks ☑️ 🛠️ Async streaming + batching now works properly ☑️ 🛠️ Logging of prompts could be disabled https://github.com/nicolay-r/bulk-chain 🚨 Guys, I am open to work as developer / researcher in AI / NLP / IR in the UK 🇬🇧 🌟 Feel free to support bulk-chain on Github if you like so, or this post. It helps alot!
