It’s no longer just about "predicting the next token"—it’s about executing latent plans on a high-speed data highway. What happens when we combine DeepSeek’s stability with Google’s strategic intelligence? 1️⃣ The Infrastructure: DeepSeek’s mHC Moving from a single-lane residual stream to a multi-lane highway. Using the Birkhoff Polytope, mHC ensures mathematical stability (Identity Mapping) while routing specialized data through dedicated lanes. 2️⃣ The Intelligence: Google’s Meta-Controller An internal AI unit that lives inside the Transformer. It escapes the "Token Trap" by extracting data to create a latent plan, steering the model via Temporal Abstraction. The Synergy: In a Topological Transformer, the Meta-Controller finally has the "dedicated lanes" it needs to steer complex reasoning without causing gradient explosions. We aren't just making models bigger; we are...</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:40:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/406965796956131</guid></item><item><title>🚀 Excited to share: The vLLM container for NVIDIA DGX Spark!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/Hellohal2064/482165788562535</link><description>🚀 Excited to share: The vLLM container for NVIDIA DGX Spark! I've been working on getting vLLM to run natively on the new DGX Spark with its GB10 Blackwell GPU (SM121 architecture). The results? 2.5x faster inference compared to llama.cpp! 📊 Performance Highlights: • Qwen3-Coder-30B: 44 tok/s (vs 21 tok/s with llama.cpp) • Qwen3-Next-80B: 45 tok/s (vs 18 tok/s with llama.cpp) 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved: • Built PyTorch nightly with CUDA 13.1 + SM121 support • Patched vLLM for Blackwell architecture • Created custom MoE expert configs for GB10 • Implemented TRITON_ATTN backend workaround 📦 Available now: • Docker Hub: docker pull hellohal2064/vllm-dgx-spark-gb10:latest • HuggingFace: huggingface.co/Hellohal2064/vllm-dgx-spark-gb10 The DGX Spark's 119GB unified memory opens up possibilities for running massive models locally.

Play with it here: 2025-ai-timeline/2025-ai-timeline Here's my personal quarterly TL;DR: 1️⃣ Q1 — Learning to Reason Deepseek not only releases a top-notch reasoning model, but shows how to train them and compete with closed frontier models. OpenAI debuts Deep Research. Significant milestones: DeepSeek R1 &amp; R1-Zero, Qwen 2.5 VL, OpenAI Deep Research, Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) 2️⃣ Q2 — Multimodality and Coding More LLMs embrace multimodality by default, and there's a surge in coding agents. Strong vision, audio, and generative models emerge. Significant milestones: Llama 4, Qwen 3, Imagen 4, OpenAI Codex, Google Jules, Claude 4 3️⃣ Q3 — "Gold" rush, OpenAI opens up, the community goes bananas Flagship models get gold in Math olympiads and hard benchmarks.

I built a Deep Research multi-agent system using NVIDIA’s Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B model and CrewAI. Try it out yourself 👇 🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rakshit2020/Deep-Research-Agent-using-CrewAI What truly made this system feel next-level was powering it with NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B, its built for real-world agentic applications. The agentic system I built: 1. First talks to you and clarifies what you actually want, removing ambiguity 2. Then creates a proper research plan based on that clarity 3. Performs deep research using web search and content extraction tools 4. Finally produces a well-structured research report grounded in sources See translation</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:40:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/RakshitAralimatti/360718325875789</guid></item><item><title>✅ New Article: *Operating an SI-Core (v0.1)*</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/kanaria007/128065561044409</link><description>✅ New Article: *Operating an SI-Core (v0.1)* Title: 🛠️ Operating SI-Core: Dashboards, Playbooks, and Human Loops 🔗 https://huggingface.co/blog/kanaria007/operating-si-core --- Summary: Designing an SI-Core is only half the job — the other half is *running it safely at 03:00*.

We are moving from linear processing to Parallel MTP-Reasoning, where we manage neural traffic across stabilized, transparent, and recursive highways. 1️⃣ The Backbone: Stabilized High-Dimensional Routing (arXiv:2512.24880) Using DeepSeek’s mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections), we solve the instability of deep MoE architectures. By projecting weight updates onto the Birkhoff Polytope, we ensure that our "Simpsons-style" expert lanes maintain mathematical identity. This is the hardware-level stability needed to run multiple reasoning paths without collapse. 2️⃣ The Vision: Gemma Scope 2 &amp; Feature Steering You can't steer what you can't see. Gemma Scope 2 provides the "X-ray" for our highways. By using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), our Meta-Controller identifies the active features in each expert lane. We don't just route data;...</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:40:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mindchain/795148891017992</guid></item></channel></rss>
