Hoping it'll work for ALL tools if lmstudio gets an update or something, not just llama.cpp, but very happy to see it works flawlessly in llama.cpp...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:37:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/bartowski/460622149989234</guid></item><item><title>Release picks of the past week is here!

Unlike traditional models that follow a single-pass think → answer pattern, Dhanishtha can think, rethink, self-evaluate, and refine mid-response using multi-phase cognitive structures like &lt;think&gt; and &lt;ser&gt; blocks. ⚡️ Highlights: - Token-Efficient — Uses up to 79% fewer tokens than DeepSeek R1 on questions - Emotionally Aware Reasoning — Thinks and reflects in real-time, no fluff --- 💻 Try It Now with the SDK from HelpingAI import HAI # pip install HelpingAI ==1.1.1 from rich import print hai = HAI( api_key = "hl-***********************" ) response = hai.chat.completions.create( model = "Dhanishtha-2.0-preview" , messages=[{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "What is the value of ∫0∞𝑥3/𝑥−1𝑑𝑥 ?" }], stream = True , hide_think = False # Hide or show models thinking ) for chunk in...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:37:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Abhaykoul/997219525730173</guid></item><item><title>Hi everyone,</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</link><description>Hi everyone, I’ve been running small language models (SLLMs) directly on smartphones — completely offline, with no cloud backend or server API calls. I wanted to share: 1. ⚡ Tokens/sec performance across several SLLMs 2. 🤖 Observations on hardware utilization (where the workload actually runs) 3. 📏 Trade-offs between model size, latency, and feasibility for mobile apps There are reports for below models - QWEN3 0.6B - NVIDIA/Nemotron QWEN 1.5B - SimpleScaling S1 - TinyLlama - Unsloth tuned Llama 3.2 1B - Naver HyperClova 0.5B 📜Comparable Benchmark reports (no cloud, all on-device): I’d really value your thoughts on: - Creative ideas to further optimize inference under these hardware constraints - Other compact LLMs worth testing on-device - Experiences you’ve had trying to deploy LLMs at the edge If there’s interest, I’m happy to share more details on the test setup, hardware specs, or the tooling we used for these comparisons. Thanks for taking a look, and you can build your own...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:37:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/yeonseok-zeticai/727857049396772</guid></item><item><title>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/pagezyhf/610118153924016</link><description>Hackathons in Paris on July 5th and 6th! Hugging Face just wrapped 4 months of deep work with AMD to push kernel-level optimization on their MI300X GPUs. Now, it's time to share everything we learned. Join us in Paris at STATION F for a hands-on weekend of workshops and a hackathon focused on making open-source LLMs faster and more efficient on AMD.

One trend that has captured the attention of many is Explainable AI. As the name suggests, this revolutionary technology aims to provide a clear, understandable explanation for the decisions and actions taken by AI systems. In the future, Explainable AI is expected to become even more sophisticated, with advanced algorithms and techniques being developed to better interpret and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by AI systems. This will not only make AI systems more reliable and trustworthy, but it will also help to demystify the world of AI, making it more accessible to a wider audience. As the demand for AI solutions grows, the need for Explainable AI will become increasingly important. Businesses, governments, and individuals will require clear, concise explanations for the AI systems they are using,...</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:37:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/ghostai1/349800616277230</guid></item></channel></rss>
