GRPO has helped DeepSeek R1 to learn reasoning. Can it also help VLMs perform stronger for general computer vision tasks? The answer is YES and it generalizes better than SFT. We trained Qwen 2.5 VL 3B on RefCOCO (a visual grounding task) and eval on RefCOCO Val and RefGTA (an OOD task). https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VLM-R1 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:23:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/tianchez/384417618281589</guid></item><item><title>The last week of Impression Craft Arts and sketches from strangerzonehfüé®üßëüèª‚Äçüé®</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/804280933500371</link><description>The last week of Impression Craft Arts and sketches from strangerzonehfüé®üßëüèª‚Äçüé® - Collection : strangerzonehf/Flux-Ultimate-LoRA-Collection Adapters: + Ld-Art : strangerzonehf/Ld-Art + Animeopix-Flux : strangerzonehf/Animeopix-Flux + Flux-Super-Paint-LoRA : strangerzonehf/Flux-Super-Paint-LoRA + CinematicShot-Pics-Flux : strangerzonehf/cinematicShot-Pics-Flux + Oil-Wall-Art-Flux : strangerzonehf/Oil-Wall-Art-Flux + Pixelo-Flux : strangerzonehf/Pixelo-Flux + Abstract-Shattered : strangerzonehf/Abstract-Shattered + Neon-Impressionism-Flux : strangerzonehf/Neon-Impressionism-Flux + NewG-Art : strangerzonehf/NewG-Art ü™ßDemo : prithivMLmods/FLUX-LoRA-DLC ü§óPage : https://huggingface.co/strangerzonehf See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:23:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/804280933500371</guid></item><item><title>I'm working on a groundbreaking AI technology that's kind of like openai's deep research but better.

Test-time compute (TTC) refers to the amount of computational power used by an AI model when generating a response. Many researchers are now focused on scaling TTC, as it enables slow, deep "thinking" and step-by-step reasoning, which improves overall models' performance. Here are 8 fresh studies on test-time scaling: 1. Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach (2502.05171) Introduces an LM that scales TTC by reasoning in latent space instead of generating more tokens with no special training. Here, a recurrent block to processes information iteratively. 2. Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models (2502.04728) Shows how TTS is applied to enhance model's Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) reasoning capabilities, which can be used to generate a symbolic world...</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:23:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/134685305854108</guid></item><item><title>hello, dev mode explorers!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nroggendorff/464265972064174</link><description>hello, dev mode explorers!

I fine-tuned HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M to generate one-line summaries from a model or dataset README. Its own self-description? "A model for generating concise summaries of model &amp; dataset cards from the Hugging Face Hub" The goal? Make it easier to find the right models and datasets for your specific needs. It's already powering a semantic search for datasets Space. It's still a WIP but thanks to @ loubnabnl , @ anton-l , @ eliebak et al, for cooking such a nice base model for fine-tuning small, efficient models for specific domains and tasks. üôè See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:23:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/966932095656116</guid></item></channel></rss>
