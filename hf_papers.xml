  Systems in LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09477</link><description>This survey integrates reasoning and retrieval in Large Language Models to improve factuality and multi-step inference, highlighting Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks and outlining future research directions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-RAG-Reasoning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 03:57:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09477</guid></item><item><title>PhysX: Physical-Grounded 3D Asset Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12465</link><description>PhysX addresses the lack of physical properties in 3D generative models by introducing PhysXNet, a physics-annotated dataset, and PhysXGen, a framework that integrates physical knowledge into 3D asset generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose PhysX, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose PhysXGen, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 02:56:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12465</guid></item><item><title>MOSPA: Human Motion Generation Driven by Spatial Audio</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11949</link><description>A diffusion-based generative framework, MOSPA, is introduced to model human motion in response to spatial audio, achieving state-of-the-art performance using the newly created SAM dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

  Understanding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12463</link><description>A large-scale benchmark, MMHU, is proposed for human behavior analysis in autonomous driving, featuring rich annotations and diverse data sources, and benchmarking multiple tasks including motion prediction and behavior question answering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans are integral components of the transportation ecosystem, and understanding their behaviors is crucial to facilitating the development of safe driving systems. Although recent progress has explored various aspects of human behaviorx2014such as motion, trajectories, and intentionx2014a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable. In this work, we propose MMHU, a large-scale benchmark for human behavior analysis featuring rich annotations, such as human motion and trajectories, text description for human motions, human intention, and critical behavior labels relevant to driving safety. Our dataset encompasses 57k human motion clips and 1.73M frames gathered from diverse sources, including established driving datasets such as Waymo, in-the-wild videos from YouTube, and self-collected data. A human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline is developed to generate rich behavior captions. We provide a thorough dataset analysis and benchmark multiple tasksx2014ranging from motion prediction to motion generation and human behavior question answeringx2014thereby offering a broad evaluation suite.

  Repositories?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12415</link><description>SWE-Perf is a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models in code performance optimization using real-world repository data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Code performance optimization is paramount in real-world software engineering and critical for production-level systems. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation and bug fixing, their proficiency in enhancing code performance at the repository level remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Perf, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on code performance optimization tasks within authentic repository contexts. SWE-Perf comprises 140 carefully curated instances, each derived from performance-improving pull requests from popular GitHub repositories. Each benchmark instance includes the relevant codebase, target functions, performance-related tests, expert-authored patches, and executable environments. Through a comprehensive evaluation of representative methods that span file-level and repo-level approaches (e.g., Agentless and OpenHands), we reveal a substantial capability gap between existing LLMs and expert-level optimization performance, highlighting critical research opportunities in this emerging field.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 05:40:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12415</guid></item><item><title>DrafterBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Tasks Automation in
  Civil Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11527</link><description>DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in technical drawing revision, assessing their capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering. DrafterBench contains twelve types of tasks summarized from real-world drawing files, with 46 customized functions/tools and 1920 tasks in total. DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark to rigorously test AI agents' proficiency in interpreting intricate and long-context instructions, leveraging prior knowledge, and adapting to dynamic instruction quality via implicit policy awareness. The toolkit comprehensively assesses distinct capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning. DrafterBench offers detailed analysis of task accuracy and error statistics, aiming to provide deeper insight into agent capabilities and identify improvement targets for integrating LLMs in engineering applications. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench, with the test set hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eason666/DrafterBench.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 03:00:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11527</guid></item><item><title>Seq vs Seq: An Open Suite of Paired Encoders and Decoders</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11412</link><description>The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation. However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks. However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 07:18:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11412</guid></item><item><title>SpatialTrackerV2: 3D Point Tracking Made Easy</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12462</link><description>SpatialTrackerV2 is a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos that integrates point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a unified, end-to-end architecture, achieving high performance and speed.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50times faster.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 03:12:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12462</guid></item><item><title>AnyI2V: Animating Any Conditional Image with Motion Control</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.02857</link><description>AnyI2V is a training-free framework that animates conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories, supporting various data types and enabling flexible video generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models, have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

  with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11764</link><description>Sentiment-augmented transformer-based classifiers improve subjectivity detection in multilingual and zero-shot settings, achieving high performance and ranking first for Greek.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings. Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English, Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages (e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base (English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 12:40:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11764</guid></item><item><title>Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09025</link><description>Lizard is a linearization framework that transforms Transformer-based LLMs into subquadratic architectures for efficient infinite-context generation, using a hybrid attention mechanism and hardware-aware training.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 03:30:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09025</guid></item><item><title>RLEP: Reinforcement Learning with Experience Replay for LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07451</link><description>RLEP, a reinforcement learning framework with experience replay, enhances large language model training by focusing on high-quality examples, leading to faster convergence and improved performance on math-related benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away from its pretrained weights. We present RLEP\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 09:06:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07451</guid></item><item><title>Replacing thinking with tool usage enables reasoning in small language
  models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05065</link><description>A new approach formats tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool for training Large Language Models, enabling faster sampling and denser reward signals for tasks like repairing Python code.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 07:55:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05065</guid></item></channel></rss>
