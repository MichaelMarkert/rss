In this work, we introduce BAGEL, an open0source foundational model that natively supports multimodal understanding and generation. BAGEL is a unified, decoder0only model pretrained on trillions of tokens curated from large0scale interleaved text, image, video, and web data. When scaled with such diverse multimodal interleaved data, BAGEL exhibits emerging capabilities in complex multimodal reasoning. As a result, it significantly outperforms open-source unified models in both multimodal generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation. In the hope of facilitating further opportunities for multimodal research, we share the key findings, pretraining details, data creation protocal, and release our code and checkpoints to the community.

  Exploration of 8-Bit Training</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11594</link><description>The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:05:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11594</guid></item><item><title>VisualQuality-R1: Reasoning-Induced Image Quality Assessment via
  Reinforcement Learning to Rank</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14460</link><description>DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 05:12:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14460</guid></item><item><title>Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14246</link><description>A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration, the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT) with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs' agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and +10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building robust and generalizable multimodal agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:02:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14246</guid></item><item><title>The Aloe Family Recipe for Open and Specialized Healthcare LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04388</link><description>Purpose: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare, the need arises for competitive open-source models to protect the public interest.

Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 08:06:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13438</guid></item><item><title>Neurosymbolic Diffusion Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13138</link><description>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 10:12:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13138</guid></item><item><title>Latent Flow Transformer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14513</link><description>Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs), typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally, we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in preserving coupling by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529), demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 02:00:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14513</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Federated Pruning for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13547</link><description>LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs, enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue, we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework, including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/FedPrLLM.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 05:57:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13547</guid></item><item><title>Visionary-R1: Mitigating Shortcuts in Visual Reasoning with
  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14677</link><description>Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 06:24:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14677</guid></item><item><title>General-Reasoner: Advancing LLM Reasoning Across All Domains</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14652</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:26:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14652</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning Models Better Express Their Confidence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14489</link><description>Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to perform slow thinking via in-context learning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 04:28:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14489</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning Path Compression: Compressing Generation Trajectories for
  Efficient LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13866</link><description>Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and throughput of token generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60times compared to the inference with full KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/ReasoningPathCompression.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:36:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13866</guid></item><item><title>Training-Free Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14673</link><description>Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG compression.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 06:23:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14673</guid></item><item><title>VideoEval-Pro: Robust and Realistic Long Video Understanding Evaluation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14640</link><description>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance (&gt;25\%) drops on open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of progress in this domain.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:33:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14640</guid></item><item><title>CS-Sum: A Benchmark for Code-Switching Dialogue Summarization and the
  Limits of Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13559</link><description>Code-switching (CS) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its comprehensibility remains underexplored in LLMs. We introduce CS-Sum, to evaluate the comprehensibility of CS by the LLMs through CS dialogue to English summarization. CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs, underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:48:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13559</guid></item><item><title>NExT-Search: Rebuilding User Feedback Ecosystem for Generative AI Search</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14680</link><description>Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline, spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search. NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside human feedback.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:48:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14680</guid></item><item><title>Think Only When You Need with Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14631</link><description>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses. However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking. Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting point for building hybrid thinking systems.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 05:52:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14631</guid></item><item><title>Reward Reasoning Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14674</link><description>Reward models play a critical role in guiding large language models toward outputs that align with human expectations. However, an open challenge remains in effectively utilizing test-time compute to enhance reward model performance. In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before generating final rewards. Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental results demonstrate that RRMs achieve superior performance on reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. Notably, we show that RRMs can adaptively exploit test-time compute to further improve reward accuracy. The pretrained reward reasoning models are available at https://huggingface.co/Reward-Reasoning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 04:27:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14674</guid></item><item><title>Hunyuan-Game: Industrial-grade Intelligent Game Creation Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14135</link><description>Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:10:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14135</guid></item><item><title>Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13430</link><description>As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18times for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 06:21:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13430</guid></item><item><title>Not All Correct Answers Are Equal: Why Your Distillation Source Matters</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14464</link><description>Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing that AM-Thinking-v1-distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench. The AM-based model consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and demonstrates adaptive output behavior-producing longer responses for harder tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and high-performing reasoning-oriented language models.

  Rationale-Guided Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12448</link><description>Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

Some tools, however, require access to untrusted data introducing risk. Adversaries can embed malicious instructions in untrusted data which cause the model to deviate from the user's expectations and mishandle their data or permissions. In this report, we set out Google DeepMind's approach to evaluating the adversarial robustness of Gemini models and describe the main lessons learned from the process. We test how Gemini performs against a sophisticated adversary through an adversarial evaluation framework, which deploys a suite of adaptive attack techniques to run continuously against past, current, and future versions of Gemini.

  interpretability</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14352</link><description>As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that they remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence that models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To explore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we train a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word without explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box) approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting. Our findings highlight the promise of these approaches for eliciting hidden knowledge and suggest several promising avenues for future work, including testing and refining these methods on more complex model organisms. This work aims to be a step towards addressing the crucial problem of eliciting secret knowledge from language models, thereby contributing to their safe and reliable deployment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 06:29:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14352</guid></item><item><title>Warm Up Before You Train: Unlocking General Reasoning in
  Resource-Constrained Settings</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13718</link><description>Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \&amp; Knaves (K\&amp;K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: (i) the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval^{+}, and MMLU-Pro. (ii) When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset (leq100 examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; (iii) Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; (iv) Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 06:05:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13718</guid></item><item><title>Two Experts Are All You Need for Steering Thinking: Reinforcing
  Cognitive Effort in MoE Reasoning Models Without Additional Training</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14681</link><description>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances, existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts (RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by tokens like ''&lt;think&gt;''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 11:21:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14681</guid></item><item><title>Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13103</link><description>The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness.   We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:25:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13103</guid></item><item><title>Truth Neurons</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12182</link><description>Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows, language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models. The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and reliability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:53:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12182</guid></item><item><title>Phare: A Safety Probe for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11365</link><description>Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes.

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with 5,102 and 300 repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively.

  Competition</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13380</link><description>Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width. However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies.

  Verifier</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11966</link><description>Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The subsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off: sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and inference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to enhance LLM reasoning at test time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 03:06:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11966</guid></item><item><title>Tokenization Constraints in LLMs: A Study of Symbolic and Arithmetic
  Reasoning Limits</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14178</link><description>Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures. Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization, allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g., o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on token-level representations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 02:21:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.14178</guid></item><item><title>To Bias or Not to Bias: Detecting bias in News with bias-detector</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.13010</link><description>Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2 cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future directions.

A Benchmark for
  Real-world Knowledge Injection</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12306</link><description>Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK, which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290 facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs), exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability accuracy by up to 29.1%.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:43:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12306</guid></item><item><title>Masking in Multi-hop QA: An Analysis of How Language Models Perform with
  Context Permutation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11754</link><description>Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task.

  artificial intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.10176</link><description>Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As the first cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100 recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems, human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers; and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability. Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical digital safety challenges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:36:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.10588</guid></item><item><title>Object-Centric Representations Improve Policy Generalization in Robot
  Manipulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11563</link><description>Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities, introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks. We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:53:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11563</guid></item></channel></rss>
