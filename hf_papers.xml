  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00819</link><description>DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy, enables dynamic length adaptation in Diffusion Large Language Models, improving performance and computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:55:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00819</guid></item><item><title>PixNerd: Pixel Neural Field Diffusion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23268</link><description>Pixel Neural Field Diffusion (PixNerd) achieves high-quality image generation in a single-scale, single-stage process without VAEs or complex pipelines, and extends to text-to-image applications with competitive performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE). However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems, researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale, single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet 256times256 and 2.84 FID on ImageNet 512times512 without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16 achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9 overall score on the DPG benchmark.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23268</guid></item><item><title>SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23361</link><description>SWE-Exp enhances software issue resolution by systematically accumulating and leveraging repair expertise from past agent experiences, improving resolution rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:42:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23361</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Referring Segmentation: A Survey</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00265</link><description>A survey of multimodal referring segmentation techniques, covering advancements in convolutional neural networks, transformers, and large language models for segmenting objects in images, videos, and 3D scenes based on text or audio instructions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions. Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers, and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images, videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression (GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on standard benchmarks are also provided.

AI-generated summary 				 Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

AI-generated summary 				 Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:41:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23348</guid></item><item><title>Learning an Efficient Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluator from Multiple Judges</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00454</link><description>An efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator aggregates multiple LLM judgments into a single model to assess dialogue quality with reduced computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the ``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 03:09:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00454</guid></item><item><title>SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware
  Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00782</link><description>SpA2V generates realistic videos aligned with input audio by leveraging spatial auditory cues and integrating them into diffusion models through video scene layouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:07:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00782</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Game Generation and Evaluation via Audio-Visual Recordings</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00632</link><description>A multi-agent system using an omni-modal evaluation metric improves JavaScript game and animation generation but struggles with custom assets and audio-visual feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging. Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a multi-agent system.   We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video, and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies good from broken or mismatched content.   We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback from the AVR.   We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However, models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental differences between human and machine content creation approaches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:59:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00632</guid></item><item><title>Investigating Hallucination in Conversations for Low Resource Languages</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.22720</link><description>LLMs generate fewer hallucinations in Mandarin compared to Hindi and Farsi across multiple models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 04:29:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.22720</guid></item><item><title>IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00823</link><description>IGL-Nav uses an incremental 3D Gaussian representation for efficient and accurate image-goal navigation in 3D space, outperforming existing methods and applicable in real-world settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.
