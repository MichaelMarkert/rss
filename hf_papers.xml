AI-generated summary 				 Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 02:07:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18866</guid></item><item><title>World-in-World: World Models in a Closed-Loop World</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18135</link><description>World-in-World evaluates generative world models in closed-loop environments, emphasizing task success over visual quality and revealing insights into controllability, data scaling, and compute allocation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 03:00:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18135</guid></item><item><title>UniGenBench++: A Unified Semantic Evaluation Benchmark for Text-to-Image
  Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18701</link><description>UniGenBench++ is a comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image generation that evaluates semantic consistency across diverse scenarios and languages using a hierarchical prompt structure and a robust evaluation pipeline.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18701</guid></item><item><title>Chem-R: Learning to Reason as a Chemist</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.16880</link><description>Chem-R, a three-phase trained Chemical Reasoning model, achieves superior performance on chemical tasks by integrating core knowledge, expert reasoning, and multi-task optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although large language models (LLMs) have significant potential to advance chemical discovery, current LLMs lack core chemical knowledge, produce unreliable reasoning trajectories, and exhibit suboptimal performance across diverse chemical tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Chem-R, a generalizable Chemical Reasoning model designed to emulate the deliberative processes of chemists. Chem-R is trained through a three-phase framework that progressively builds advanced reasoning capabilities, including: 1) Chemical Foundation Training, which establishes core chemical knowledge. 2) Chemical Reasoning Protocol Distillation, incorporating structured, expert-like reasoning traces to guide systematic and reliable problem solving. 3) Multi-task Group Relative Policy Optimization that optimizes the model for balanced performance across diverse molecular- and reaction-level tasks. This structured pipeline enables Chem-R to achieve state-of-the-art performance on comprehensive benchmarks, surpassing leading large language models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1, by up to 46% on molecular tasks and 66% on reaction tasks. Meanwhile, Chem-R also consistently outperforms the existing chemical foundation models across both molecular and reaction level tasks. These results highlight Chem-R's robust generalization, interpretability, and potential as a foundation for next-generation AI-driven chemical discovery.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:58:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.16880</guid></item><item><title>MoGA: Mixture-of-Groups Attention for End-to-End Long Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18692</link><description>Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) enables efficient long video generation by addressing the quadratic scaling issue of full attention in Diffusion Transformers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps, with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:56:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18692</guid></item><item><title>Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for
  Multimodal LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18876</link><description>Grasp Any Region (GAR) enhances region-level visual understanding by integrating global contexts and modeling interactions, achieving advanced reasoning and outperforming existing models in captioning and video reference tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:47:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18876</guid></item><item><title>IF-VidCap: Can Video Caption Models Follow Instructions?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18726</link><description>A new benchmark, IF-VidCap, evaluates video captioning models on instruction-following capabilities, revealing that top-tier open-source models are closing the performance gap with proprietary models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive, unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:54:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18726</guid></item><item><title>Towards Faithful and Controllable Personalization via Critique-Post-Edit
  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18849</link><description>A Critique-Post-Edit framework enhances personalization of large language models by integrating a multi-dimensional reward model and a self-revision mechanism, outperforming standard methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 02:53:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18849</guid></item><item><title>Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale
  Thinking Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18855</link><description>Ring-1T, a trillion-parameter open-source thinking model, addresses training challenges with IcePop, C3PO++, and ASystem, achieving top results across benchmarks and democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:51:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18855</guid></item><item><title>MT-Video-Bench: A Holistic Video Understanding Benchmark for Evaluating
  Multimodal LLMs in Multi-Turn Dialogues</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17722</link><description>MT-Video-Bench evaluates MLLMs in multi-turn video dialogues, assessing perceptivity and interactivity across diverse domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:54:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17722</guid></item><item><title>ProCLIP: Progressive Vision-Language Alignment via LLM-based Embedder</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18795</link><description>ProCLIP enhances CLIP's text processing capabilities by aligning its image encoder with an LLM-based embedder through curriculum learning and contrastive tuning, preserving CLIP's pretrained knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

  Fine-tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18250</link><description>ssToken, a self-modulated and semantic-aware token selection approach, enhances supervised fine-tuning of large language models by adaptively selecting tokens and providing complementary semantic information, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model, and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model, which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric, orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:02:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18250</guid></item><item><title>MUG-V 10B: High-efficiency Training Pipeline for Large Video Generation
  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17519</link><description>A training framework for large-scale video generation models optimizes data processing, model architecture, training strategy, and infrastructure, resulting in a model that matches state-of-the-art performance and is open-sourced with Megatron-Core-based training code.  					AI-generated summary 				 In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (e.g., images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V{our webpage}.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 02:31:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17519</guid></item><item><title>DSI-Bench: A Benchmark for Dynamic Spatial Intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18873</link><description>DSI-Bench evaluates the dynamic spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language and visual expertise models through a benchmark of dynamic videos and annotated questions, highlighting their limitations in understanding self-motion, object motion, and relative relationships.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:45:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18873</guid></item><item><title>UltraGen: High-Resolution Video Generation with Hierarchical Attention</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18775</link><description>UltraGen, a novel video generation framework, enables efficient high-resolution video synthesis using a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture and spatially compressed global modeling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation, entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (&lt;=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:54:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18775</guid></item><item><title>Video Reasoning without Training</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17045</link><description>The paper proposes V-Reason, a method that tunes the behavior of Large Multimodal Models during inference using entropy-based optimization, improving video reasoning accuracy and efficiency without reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 02:28:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.17045</guid></item><item><title>Unleashing Scientific Reasoning for Bio-experimental Protocol Generation
  via Structured Component-based Reward Mechanism</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.15600</link><description>Thoth, a large language model trained with the Sketch-and-Fill paradigm and structured component-based reward mechanism, generates more reliable and executable scientific protocols compared to existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:37:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.15600</guid></item></channel></rss>
