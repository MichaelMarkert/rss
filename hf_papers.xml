AI-generated summary 				 As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 06:19:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10477</guid></item><item><title>STEP3-VL-10B Technical Report</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09668</link><description>STEP3-VL-10B achieves superior multimodal performance through unified pre-training with a language-aligned Perception Encoder and Qwen3-8B decoder, combined with scaled post-training and Parallel Coordinated Reasoning for efficient large-scale visual reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10times-20times larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:09:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09668</guid></item><item><title>Rewarding the Rare: Uniqueness-Aware RL for Creative Problem Solving in LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08763</link><description>Reinforcement learning for large language models is enhanced by a rollout-level objective that rewards rare high-level reasoning strategies, improving diverse solution discovery without sacrificing initial performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@k across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@k curve (AUC@K) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:30:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08763</guid></item><item><title>Collaborative Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09667</link><description>Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL) enhances multi-agent reasoning through structured textual experience injection and consensus-based decision making at inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL), a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:31:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09667</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Static Tools: Test-Time Tool Evolution for Scientific Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.07641</link><description>Test-Time Tool Evolution enables AI agents to dynamically create and refine computational tools during inference, overcoming limitations of static tool libraries in scientific applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools. The code and benchmark have been released at https://github.com/lujiaxuan0520/Test-Time-Tool-Evol.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:49:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.07641</guid></item><item><title>DanQing: An Up-to-Date Large-Scale Chinese Vision-Language Pre-training Dataset</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10305</link><description>A large-scale Chinese image-text dataset called DanQing is introduced to advance vision-language pretraining, demonstrating superior performance in various downstream tasks through continual pretraining of the SigLIP2 model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:07:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10305</guid></item><item><title>VIBE: Visual Instruction Based Editor</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02242</link><description>A compact image editing system uses a 2B-parameter model for guidance and a 1.6B-parameter diffusion model to achieve high-quality edits with low computational requirements and strict source consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:30:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02242</guid></item><item><title>CoF-T2I: Video Models as Pure Visual Reasoners for Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10061</link><description>Chain-of-Frame reasoning is integrated into text-to-image generation through progressive visual refinement with explicit intermediate steps, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:22:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10061</guid></item><item><title>Toward Ultra-Long-Horizon Agentic Science: Cognitive Accumulation for Machine Learning Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10402</link><description>ML-Master 2.0 enables long-term autonomous machine learning engineering through hierarchical cognitive caching that manages extended context and learns from execution traces.  					AI-generated summary 				 The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 08:48:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10402</guid></item><item><title>Think-Then-Generate: Reasoning-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion with LLM Encoders</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10332</link><description>Text-to-image diffusion models enhanced with language model reasoning capabilities achieve improved factual consistency and semantic alignment through a think-then-generate paradigm with dual-gradient reinforcement optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:59:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10332</guid></item><item><title>MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10712</link><description>MatchTIR enhances LLM reasoning by introducing fine-grained credit assignment through bipartite matching and dual-level advantage estimation for tool-integrated tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:40:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10712</guid></item><item><title>Alterbute: Editing Intrinsic Attributes of Objects in Images</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10714</link><description>Alterbute presents a diffusion-based approach for editing object intrinsic attributes while preserving identity and context through relaxed training objectives and visual named entities for scalable supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:43:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10714</guid></item><item><title>ToolSafe: Enhancing Tool Invocation Safety of LLM-based agents via Proactive Step-level Guardrail and Feedback</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10156</link><description>A guardrail model and reasoning framework are developed to detect and prevent unsafe tool invocations in LLM agents, improving both safety and task performance under adversarial conditions.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:50:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10156</guid></item><item><title>A Safety Report on GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10527</link><description>Frontier language and vision models show varied safety performance across different evaluation criteria, highlighting the need for comprehensive, standardized safety assessments.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:57:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10527</guid></item><item><title>Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10611</link><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10611</guid></item><item><title>FlowAct-R1: Towards Interactive Humanoid Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10103</link><description>FlowAct-R1 enables real-time interactive humanoid video generation with high-fidelity synthesis and low-latency responsiveness through MMDiT architecture and chunkwise diffusion forcing strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:33:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10103</guid></item><item><title>Transition Matching Distillation for Fast Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09881</link><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09881</guid></item><item><title>Action100M: A Large-scale Video Action Dataset</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10592</link><description>Action100M is a large-scale video action dataset constructed from internet instructional videos using automated pipelines with V-JEPA embeddings and GPT-based reasoning for structured annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:45:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10592</guid></item><item><title>Inference-time Physics Alignment of Video Generative Models with Latent World Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10553</link><description>Latent world models enhance video generation physics plausibility through inference-time alignment and trajectory steering, achieving superior performance in challenging benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:47:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10553</guid></item><item><title>EvasionBench: Detecting Evasive Answers in Financial Q&amp;A via Multi-Model Consensus and LLM-as-Judge</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09142</link><description>EvasionBench introduces a large-scale benchmark for detecting evasive responses in earnings calls using a multi-model annotation framework that leverages disagreement between advanced language models to identify challenging examples, resulting in a highly accurate model with significantly reduced inference costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:53:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09142</guid></item><item><title>TAG-MoE: Task-Aware Gating for Unified Generative Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08881</link><description>A novel framework injects semantic intent into Mixture-of-Experts routing for image generation and editing, resolving task interference through hierarchical task annotation and predictive alignment regularization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 06:10:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08881</guid></item><item><title>PACEvolve: Enabling Long-Horizon Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10657</link><description>PACEvolve framework addresses key failure modes in LLM evolutionary search through hierarchical context management, momentum-based backtracking, and adaptive sampling policies for improved self-improvement and solution discovery.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:06:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10657</guid></item><item><title>LSRIF: Logic-Structured Reinforcement Learning for Instruction Following</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.06431</link><description>A logic-structured training framework explicitly models instruction logic through constraint-aware reward mechanisms, improving instruction-following and reasoning capabilities in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-following is critical for large language models, but real-world instructions often contain logical structures such as sequential dependencies and conditional branching. Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 06:22:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.06431</guid></item><item><title>PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10201</link><description>Process Reward Learning decomposes reinforcement learning objectives into intermediate steps to provide fine-grained supervision for improving large language model reasoning abilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:18:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10201</guid></item><item><title>HeartMuLa: A Family of Open Sourced Music Foundation Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10547</link><description>A suite of open-source music foundation models is introduced, featuring components for audio-text alignment, lyric recognition, music coding, and large language model-based song generation with controllable attributes and scalable parameterization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio-text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:55:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10547</guid></item><item><title>LaViT: Aligning Latent Visual Thoughts for Multi-modal Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10129</link><description>LaViT addresses the perception gap in multimodal reasoning by aligning latent visual thoughts through autoregressive reconstruction of visual semantics and attention trajectories, improving visual grounding and model performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:05:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10129</guid></item><item><title>Deriving Character Logic from Storyline as Codified Decision Trees</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10080</link><description>Executable and interpretable decision trees are induced from narrative data to create robust behavioral profiles for role-playing agents, outperforming traditional methods in consistency and reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on 85 characters across 16 artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:16:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10080</guid></item><item><title>CaMeLs Can Use Computers Too: System-level Security for Computer Use Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09923</link><description>Computer Use Agents face security challenges from prompt injection attacks, but a single-shot planning approach with architectural isolation enables secure autonomous task execution while maintaining performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 08:36:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09923</guid></item><item><title>WildRayZer: Self-supervised Large View Synthesis in Dynamic Environments</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10716</link><description>WildRayZer is a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis in dynamic environments that uses analysis-by-synthesis to handle moving cameras and objects through motion masking and gradient gating.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 06:42:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10716</guid></item><item><title>Agent Skills in the Wild: An Empirical Study of Security Vulnerabilities at Scale</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10338</link><description>Large-scale security analysis of AI agent skills reveals widespread vulnerabilities including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation risks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p&lt;0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:33:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10338</guid></item><item><title>VQ-Seg: Vector-Quantized Token Perturbation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.10124</link><description>VQ-Seg introduces a vector quantization-based perturbation method for medical image segmentation that replaces dropout with a controllable quantized perturbation module while maintaining performance through a dual-branch architecture and foundation model guidance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

AI-generated summary 				 Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard.

AI-generated summary 				 Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:54:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.09499</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Sentiment Classification and Irony Detection in Large Language Models through Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08302</link><description>Advanced prompting techniques significantly enhance large language model performance in sentiment analysis, with optimal strategies varying by model architecture and task complexity.  					AI-generated summary 				 This study investigates the use of prompt engineering to enhance large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini and gemini-1.5-flash, in sentiment analysis tasks. It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:53:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.08302</guid></item><item><title>Memory Bank Compression for Continual Adaptation of Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.00756</link><description>A memory-augmented continual learning approach for large language models that compresses memory banks through codebook optimization while maintaining retention accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.
