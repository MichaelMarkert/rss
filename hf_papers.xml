AI-generated summary 				 Despite the success of multimodal contrastive learning in aligning visual and linguistic representations, a persistent geometric anomaly, the Modality Gap, remains: embeddings of distinct modalities expressing identical semantics occupy systematically offset regions. Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:31:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07026</guid></item><item><title>Alleviating Sparse Rewards by Modeling Step-Wise and Long-Term Sampling Effects in Flow-Based GRPO</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06422</link><description>TP-GRPO addresses reward sparsity in flow matching models by introducing step-level incremental rewards and identifying turning points to capture long-term effects in denoising trajectories.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:49:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06422</guid></item><item><title>MOVA: Towards Scalable and Synchronized Video-Audio Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08794</link><description>MOVA is an open-source model that generates synchronized audio-visual content using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 32 billion parameters, supporting image-text to video-audio generation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:48:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08794</guid></item><item><title>LLaDA2.1: Speeding Up Text Diffusion via Token Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08676</link><description>LLaDA2.1 introduces a novel token-to-token editing approach with speed and quality modes, enhanced through reinforcement learning for improved reasoning and instruction following in large language diffusion models.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLaDA2.0 showcased the scaling potential of 100B-level block-diffusion models and their inherent parallelization, the delicate equilibrium between decoding speed and generation quality has remained an elusive frontier. Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed. Despite its 100B volume, on coding tasks it attains an astounding 892 TPS on HumanEval+, 801 TPS on BigCodeBench, and 663 TPS on LiveCodeBench.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:44:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08676</guid></item><item><title>QuantaAlpha: An Evolutionary Framework for LLM-Driven Alpha Mining</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07085</link><description>Financial markets are noisy and non-stationary, making alpha mining highly sensitive to noise in backtesting results and sudden market regime shifts. While recent agentic frameworks improve alpha mining automation, they often lack controllable multi-round search and reliable reuse of validated experience. To address these challenges, we propose QuantaAlpha, an evolutionary alpha mining framework that treats each end-to-end mining run as a trajectory and improves factors through trajectory-level mutation and crossover operations. QuantaAlpha localizes suboptimal steps in each trajectory for targeted revision and recombines complementary high-reward segments to reuse effective patterns, enabling structured exploration and refinement across mining iterations. During factor generation, QuantaAlpha enforces semantic consistency across the hypothesis, factor expression, and executable code, while constraining the complexity and redundancy of the generated factor to mitigate crowding. Extensive experiments on the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) demonstrate consistent gains over strong baseline models and prior agentic systems. When utilizing GPT-5.2, QuantaAlpha achieves an Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.1501, with an Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) of 27.75% and a Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 7.98%. Moreover, factors mined on CSI 300 transfer effectively to the China Securities Index 500 (CSI 500) and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (S&amp;P 500), delivering 160% and 137% cumulative excess return over four years, respectively, which indicates strong robustness of QuantaAlpha under market distribution shifts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:49:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07085</guid></item><item><title>Recurrent-Depth VLA: Implicit Test-Time Compute Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models via Latent Iterative Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07845</link><description>RD-VLA introduces a recurrent architecture for vision-language-action models that adapts computational depth through latent iterative refinement, achieving constant memory usage and improved task success rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of carrying out long-running, real-world tasks. However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as "context rot". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:02:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07962</guid></item><item><title>Demo-ICL: In-Context Learning for Procedural Video Knowledge Acquisition</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08439</link><description>Researchers introduce a new video understanding task and benchmark that evaluates models' ability to learn from few-shot demonstrations, along with a specialized MLLM architecture trained using a two-stage approach combining video supervision and preference optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing video understanding capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing video benchmarks primarily assess understanding based on models' static, internal knowledge, rather than their ability to learn and adapt from dynamic, novel contexts from few examples. To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:33:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08439</guid></item><item><title>LatentChem: From Textual CoT to Latent Thinking in Chemical Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07075</link><description>LatentChem enables chemical reasoning through continuous latent space computations instead of discrete textual tokens, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chemical large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in natural language to perform complex reasoning. However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84times average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:52:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07075</guid></item><item><title>RelayGen: Intra-Generation Model Switching for Efficient Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06454</link><description>RelayGen is a training-free framework that dynamically switches between large and small models during reasoning by identifying difficulty transitions at the segment level, achieving faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning trajectories, but inference-time scaling incurs substantial deployment cost. A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present RelayGen, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models. When combined with speculative decoding, RelayGen achieves up to 2.2times end-to-end speedup with less than 2\% accuracy degradation, without requiring additional training or learned routing components.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:58:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06454</guid></item><item><title>Theory of Space: Can Foundation Models Construct Spatial Beliefs through Active Exploration?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07055</link><description>Current multimodal foundation models show limitations in maintaining coherent spatial beliefs during active exploration, exhibiting gaps between active and passive performance, inefficient exploration strategies, and difficulties in updating outdated spatial knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:10:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07055</guid></item><item><title>AgentCPM-Report: Interleaving Drafting and Deepening for Open-Ended Deep Research</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06540</link><description>AgentCPM-Report presents a lightweight local solution for deep research report generation using a Writing As Reasoning Policy framework and multi-stage agentic training to enhance small models' reasoning and outline evolution capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:27:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06540</guid></item><item><title>InternAgent-1.5: A Unified Agentic Framework for Long-Horizon Autonomous Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08990</link><description>InternAgent-1.5 is a unified system for autonomous scientific discovery that integrates computational modeling and experimental research through coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce InternAgent-1.5, a unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:25:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08990</guid></item><item><title>WorldCompass: Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon World Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09022</link><description>WorldCompass enhances long-horizon video-based world models through reinforcement learning post-training with clip-level rollouts, complementary rewards, and efficient RL algorithms.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents WorldCompass, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training framework for the long-horizon, interactive video-based world models, enabling them to explore the world more accurately and consistently based on interaction signals. To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:41:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09022</guid></item><item><title>NanoQuant: Efficient Sub-1-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06694</link><description>NanoQuant enables efficient post-training quantization of large language models to binary and sub-1-bit levels using low-rank binary factorization and ADMM optimization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing memory requirements for consumer hardware deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8times in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:33:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06694</guid></item><item><title>Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.21363</link><description>Off-policy Soft Actor-Critic with large-batch updates enables efficient humanoid locomotion policy pretraining, while model-based methods facilitate safe adaptation through deterministic data collection and stochastic exploration within physics-informed world models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 08:59:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.21363</guid></item><item><title>When and How Much to Imagine: Adaptive Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Visual Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08236</link><description>Adaptive test-time framework with world models enables selective visual imagination for spatial reasoning, improving efficiency and reliability by determining when imagination is necessary.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:12:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08236</guid></item><item><title>Reliable and Responsible Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08145</link><description>Foundation models including LLMs, MLLMs, and generative models require reliable and responsible development addressing bias, security, explainability, and other critical issues for trustworthy deployment across multiple domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Foundation models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Image Generative Models (i.e, Text-to-Image Models and Image-Editing Models), and Video Generative Models, have become essential tools with broad applications across various domains such as law, medicine, education, finance, science, and beyond. As these models see increasing real-world deployment, ensuring their reliability and responsibility has become critical for academia, industry, and government. This survey addresses the reliable and responsible development of foundation models. We explore critical issues, including bias and fairness, security and privacy, uncertainty, explainability, and distribution shift. Our research also covers model limitations, such as hallucinations, as well as methods like alignment and Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) detection. For each area, we review the current state of the field and outline concrete future research directions. Additionally, we discuss the intersections between these areas, highlighting their connections and shared challenges. We hope our survey fosters the development of foundation models that are not only powerful but also ethical, trustworthy, reliable, and socially responsible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:56:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08145</guid></item><item><title>WildReward: Learning Reward Models from In-the-Wild Human Interactions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08829</link><description>WildReward demonstrates that reward models can be effectively trained from in-the-wild user interactions using ordinal regression, achieving performance comparable to traditional methods while benefiting from user diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training of large language models (LLMs), yet they typically rely on large-scale human-annotated preference pairs. With the widespread deployment of LLMs, in-the-wild interactions have emerged as a rich source of implicit reward signals. This raises the question: Can we develop reward models directly from in-the-wild interactions? In this work, we explore this possibility by adopting WildChat as an interaction source and proposing a pipeline to extract reliable human feedback, yielding 186k high-quality instances for training WildReward via ordinal regression directly on user feedback without preference pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WildReward achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to conventional reward models, with improved calibration and cross-sample consistency. We also observe that WildReward benefits directly from user diversity, where more users yield stronger reward models. Finally, we apply WildReward to online DPO training and observe significant improvements across various tasks.

AI-generated summary 				 Generating step-by-step "how-to" procedures is a key LLM capability: how-to advice is commonly requested in chatbots, and step-by-step planning is critical for reasoning over complex tasks. Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by &gt;10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:35:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08808</guid></item><item><title>GISA: A Benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistant</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08543</link><description>A new benchmark called GISA is introduced for evaluating information-seeking assistants, featuring human-crafted queries with structured answer formats and live updates to prevent memorization.  					AI-generated summary 				 The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated the development of search agents capable of autonomously gathering information through multi-turn web interactions. Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:20:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08543</guid></item><item><title>SoulX-Singer: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07803</link><description>A high-quality open-source singing voice synthesis system is presented with support for multiple languages and controllable generation, along with a dedicated benchmark for evaluating zero-shot performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:08:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07803</guid></item><item><title>Rolling Sink: Bridging Limited-Horizon Training and Open-Ended Testing in Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07775</link><description></description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:12:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07775</guid></item><item><title>Concept-Aware Privacy Mechanisms for Defending Embedding Inversion Attacks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07090</link><description>SPARSE is a user-centric framework that protects text embeddings from privacy leaks by selectively perturbing sensitive dimensions using differentiable masking and Mahalanobis noise calibration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text embeddings enable numerous NLP applications but face severe privacy risks from embedding inversion attacks, which can expose sensitive attributes or reconstruct raw text. Existing differential privacy defenses assume uniform sensitivity across embedding dimensions, leading to excessive noise and degraded utility. We propose SPARSE, a user-centric framework for concept-specific privacy protection in text embeddings. SPARSE combines (1) differentiable mask learning to identify privacy-sensitive dimensions for user-defined concepts, and (2) the Mahalanobis mechanism that applies elliptical noise calibrated by dimension sensitivity. Unlike traditional spherical noise injection, SPARSE selectively perturbs privacy-sensitive dimensions while preserving non-sensitive semantics. Evaluated across six datasets with three embedding models and attack scenarios, SPARSE consistently reduces privacy leakage while achieving superior downstream performance compared to state-of-the-art DP methods.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:41:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07090</guid></item><item><title>ECO: Energy-Constrained Optimization with Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Walking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06445</link><description>Energy-constrained optimization framework separates energy metrics from rewards using Lagrangian method to achieve stable, energy-efficient humanoid robot locomotion with reduced hyperparameter tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.
