AI-generated summary 				 Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:05:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.20785</guid></item><item><title>Envision: Benchmarking Unified Understanding &amp; Generation for Causal World Process Insights</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01816</link><description>A benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation assesses models' ability to model dynamic causal processes and world knowledge, revealing that unified multimodal models outperform specialized ones but still struggle with spatiotemporal consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:01:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01816</guid></item><item><title>What about gravity in video generation? Post-Training Newton's Laws with Verifiable Rewards</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00425</link><description>A physics-grounded post-training framework using verifiable rewards improves physical realism and motion quality in video diffusion models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet often violate basic physical laws-objects float, accelerations drift, and collisions behave inconsistently-revealing a persistent gap between visual realism and physical realism. We propose NewtonRewards, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on verifiable rewards. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, NewtonRewards extracts measurable proxies from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate NewtonRewards on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, NewtonBench-60K. Across all primitives in visual and physics metrics, NewtonRewards consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior post-training methods. It further maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction. Our results show that physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:25:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00425</guid></item><item><title>How Far Are We from Genuinely Useful Deep Research Agents?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01948</link><description>FINDER is a benchmark for deep research agents with standardized human-curated tasks and DEFT is a failure taxonomy revealing that DRAs struggle with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis. However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:55:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01948</guid></item><item><title>Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.20649</link><description>A new inference-time framework, $\infty$-RoPE, addresses limitations in autoregressive video diffusion models by enabling continuous video generation, fine-grained action control, and cinematic transitions without retraining.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce infty-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish infty-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that infty-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:04:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.20649</guid></item><item><title>TUNA: Taming Unified Visual Representations for Native Unified Multimodal Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.02014</link><description>TUNA, a unified multimodal model, uses a cascaded VAE and representation encoder for end-to-end multimodal understanding and generation, outperforming decoupled models and achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:27:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.02014</guid></item><item><title>GR-RL: Going Dexterous and Precise for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01801</link><description>GR-RL enhances a vision-language-action policy for long-horizon dexterous manipulation through a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and refines demonstrations using reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting Q-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:20:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01801</guid></item><item><title>Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01374</link><description>The paper provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing sequence-level rewards in reinforcement learning using token-level objectives, highlighting the importance of techniques like importance sampling correction, clipping, and Routing Replay for stabilizing training, especially with large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 05:17:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01374</guid></item><item><title>SpeContext: Enabling Efficient Long-context Reasoning with Speculative Context Sparsity in LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00722</link><description>SpeContext leverages a distilled language model for efficient long-context reasoning, reducing parameters and improving throughput with minimal accuracy loss in both cloud and edge environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we point out that the objective of the retrieval algorithms is to align with the LLM, which is similar to the objective of knowledge distillation in LLMs. We analyze the similarity in information focus between the distilled language model(DLM) and the original LLM from the perspective of information theory, and thus propose a novel paradigm that leverages a DLM as the retrieval algorithm. Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving &gt; 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:18:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00722</guid></item><item><title>The Consistency Critic: Correcting Inconsistencies in Generated Images via Reference-Guided Attentive Alignment</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.20614</link><description>ImageCritic addresses image generation inconsistencies using reference-guided post-editing with attention alignment loss and a detail encoder, improving fine-grained detail accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Previous works have explored various customized generation tasks given a reference image, but they still face limitations in generating consistent fine-grained details. In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model's attention mechanisms and intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder to precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round and local editing in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:06:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.20614</guid></item><item><title>Rectifying LLM Thought from Lens of Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01925</link><description>RePro, a novel process-level reward mechanism, enhances LLM reasoning by refining the optimization process underlying chain-of-thought prompting, thereby improving performance and reducing suboptimal behaviors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:29:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01925</guid></item><item><title>VLASH: Real-Time VLAs via Future-State-Aware Asynchronous Inference</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01031</link><description></description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 05:24:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01031</guid></item><item><title>HiconAgent: History Context-aware Policy Optimization for GUI Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01763</link><description>HiconAgent, a GUI agent using HCPO, efficiently utilizes historical context for better performance in navigation tasks with reduced computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:03:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01763</guid></item><item><title>InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01342</link><description></description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 05:24:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01342</guid></item><item><title>Lotus-2: Advancing Geometric Dense Prediction with Powerful Image Generative Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01030</link><description>A two-stage deterministic framework, Lotus-2, leverages diffusion models' world priors for high-quality geometric inference, achieving state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and competitive surface normal prediction with limited training data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:51:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01030</guid></item><item><title>Seeing the Wind from a Falling Leaf</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00762</link><description>An end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework recovers force representations from video observations, enabling physics-based video generation and editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 A longstanding goal in computer vision is to model motions from videos, while the representations behind motions, i.e. the invisible physical interactions that cause objects to deform and move, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos. Furthermore, we show the potential applications of our approach, including physics-based video generation and editing. We hope our approach sheds light on understanding and modeling the physical process behind pixels, bridging the gap between vision and physics.

AI-generated summary 				 Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:04:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01481</guid></item><item><title>PromptBridge: Cross-Model Prompt Transfer for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01420</link><description>PromptBridge is a framework that facilitates prompt transfer between different LLMs to maintain performance without re-optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 05:17:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01420</guid></item><item><title>Generalist Large Language Models Outperform Clinical Tools on Medical Benchmarks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01191</link><description>Generalist LLMs outperform specialized clinical AI assistants in a multi-task benchmark, highlighting the need for independent evaluation of clinical decision support tools.  					AI-generated summary 				 Specialized clinical AI assistants are rapidly entering medical practice, often framed as safer or more reliable than general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:44:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.01191</guid></item><item><title>WiseEdit: Benchmarking Cognition- and Creativity-Informed Image Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00387</link><description>WiseEdit is a benchmark for evaluating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing models by decomposing the process into Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination tasks, assessing them on declarative, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities.

AI-generated summary 				 Test-time scaling (TTS) -- the dynamic allocation of compute during inference -- is a promising direction for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 05:19:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.02008</guid></item><item><title>Doppler-Enhanced Deep Learning: Improving Thyroid Nodule Segmentation with YOLOv5 Instance Segmentation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00639</link><description>YOLOv5 algorithms enhance thyroid nodule segmentation accuracy in ultrasound images, particularly when incorporating doppler images, offering a real-time solution for clinical diagnostics.  					AI-generated summary 				 The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:55:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00639</guid></item><item><title>IndicParam: Benchmark to evaluate LLMs on low-resource Indic Languages</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00333</link><description>IndicParam benchmark evaluates multiple-choice question performance of LLMs across 11 Indic languages, revealing limitations in cross-lingual transfer and grammatical proficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 19 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing GPT-5 reaches only 45.0% average accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1) and Claude-4.5 (42.7). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. IndicParam provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:47:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00333</guid></item></channel></rss>
