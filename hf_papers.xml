AI-generated summary 				 Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 03:35:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05748</guid></item><item><title>Matrix-3D: Omnidirectional Explorable 3D World Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08086</link><description>Matrix-3D generates wide-coverage 3D worlds from single images or text using panoramic video diffusion and reconstruction models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation.

  Asynchronous RL</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.07976</link><description>ASearcher is an open-source project that uses scalable asynchronous RL training to enhance search agents, achieving high performance on QA tasks with long-horizon search capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. &lt;=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 03:04:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.07976</guid></item><item><title>Time Is a Feature: Exploiting Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Language
  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09138</link><description>Two methods, Temporal Self-Consistency Voting and Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, improve diffusion large language models by leveraging temporal consistency in intermediate predictions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 01:54:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09138</guid></item><item><title>CharacterShot: Controllable and Consistent 4D Character Animation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.07409</link><description>CharacterShot is a 4D character animation framework that uses a DiT-based model and dual-attention module to generate consistent 3D animations from a single image and 2D pose sequence.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we propose CharacterShot, a controllable and consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally, we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark, CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jeoyal/CharacterShot.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:49:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.07409</guid></item><item><title>HierSearch: A Hierarchical Enterprise Deep Search Framework Integrating
  Local and Web Searches</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08088</link><description>HierSearch, a hierarchical agentic deep search framework using hierarchical RL, improves performance in multi-source retrieval tasks by coordinating local and Web search agents and refining knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 02:38:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08088</guid></item><item><title>Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for GUI Grounding via Region
  Consistency</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05615</link><description>GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO enhance GUI grounding accuracy by leveraging spatial consistency and reinforcement learning without additional training data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 02:08:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05615</guid></item><item><title>UNCAGE: Contrastive Attention Guidance for Masked Generative
  Transformers in Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05399</link><description>UNCAGE, a training-free method using contrastive attention guidance, enhances compositional fidelity in text-to-image generation by prioritizing the unmasking of object-representing tokens.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance (UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 02:10:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05399</guid></item><item><title>VertexRegen: Mesh Generation with Continuous Level of Detail</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09062</link><description>VertexRegen generates meshes with continuous detail by reversing edge collapse through a generative model, offering anytime generation and flexibility in detail levels.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of detail.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 05:04:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09062</guid></item><item><title>Aryabhata: An exam-focused language model for JEE Math</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08665</link><description>Aryabhata 1.0, a compact math reasoning model, outperforms existing models on educational exams and benchmarks by using supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, and novel exploration strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through best-of-n rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with group-relative advantage estimation alongwith novel exploration strategies such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K) benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency, while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small language models. This marks our first open release for community feedback (https://huggingface.co/PhysicsWallahAI/Aryabhata-1.0{Aryabhata 1.0 on Hugging Face}); PW is actively training future models to further improve learning outcomes for students.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:35:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08665</guid></item><item><title>Train Long, Think Short: Curriculum Learning for Efficient Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08940</link><description>A curriculum learning strategy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances the reasoning abilities of large language models by progressively tightening token budgets, improving accuracy and token efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget, achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design, showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/curriculum_grpo.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:31:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08940</guid></item><item><title>Adversarial Video Promotion Against Text-to-Video Retrieval</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.06964</link><description>The Video Promotion attack (ViPro) enhances the robustness of text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) by promoting videos towards selected queries, demonstrating significant improvements over existing baselines in various attack scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined. Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries, i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially, dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement (MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously. We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro surpasses other baselines by over 30/10/4% for white/grey/black-box settings on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:58:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.06964</guid></item><item><title>Cut2Next: Generating Next Shot via In-Context Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08244</link><description>Cut2Next, a framework using a Diffusion Transformer with in-context tuning and hierarchical prompting, generates high-quality, cinematically coherent shots that adhere to professional editing patterns.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation (NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity. Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically coherent subsequent shots.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:31:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08244</guid></item><item><title>OpenCUA: Open Foundations for Computer-Use Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09123</link><description>OpenCUA is an open-source framework for vision-language models as computer-use agents, featuring an annotation infrastructure, a large-scale dataset, and a scalable pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:23:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09123</guid></item><item><title>AutoCodeBench: Large Language Models are Automatic Code Benchmark
  Generators</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09101</link><description>AutoCodeGen creates a large-scale, multilingual code generation benchmark, AutoCodeBench, to evaluate LLMs on diverse and complex tasks without manual annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second, most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising 3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity, diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 03:08:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09101</guid></item><item><title>DeCRED: Decoder-Centric Regularization for Encoder-Decoder Based Speech
  Recognition</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08938</link><description>Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED) improves ASR robustness and generalization by adding auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, reducing internal language model perplexity and WER.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both in- and out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6% relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and 18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:02:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08938</guid></item><item><title>Feedback-Driven Tool-Use Improvements in Large Language Models via
  Automated Build Environments</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08791</link><description>An automated pipeline for constructing training environments and a verifiable reward mechanism enhance large language models' tool-use performance without compromising general capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models' tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:05:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08791</guid></item><item><title>Bridging Theory and Practice in Quantum Game Theory: Optimized
  Implementation of the Battle of the Sexes with Error Mitigation on NISQ
  Hardware</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09050</link><description>Quantum game theory demonstrated on IBM Quantum hardware using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein framework shows persistent quantum advantages in strategic coordination despite noise and decoherence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Implementing quantum game theory on real hardware is challenging due to noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity, yet such demonstrations are essential to validate theoretical predictions. We present one of the first full experimental realizations of the Battle of the Sexes game under the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework on IBM Quantum's ibm sherbrooke superconducting processor. Four quantum strategies (I, H, R(pi/4), R(pi)) were evaluated across 31 entanglement values gamma in [0, pi] using 2048 shots per configuration, enabling a direct comparison between analytical predictions and hardware execution. To mitigate noise and variability, we introduce a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method that dynamically selects qubit pairs and optimizes routing based on real-time topology and calibration data. The analytical model forecasts up to 108% payoff improvement over the classical equilibrium, and despite hardware-induced deviations, experimental results with GCM preserve the expected payoff trends within 3.5%-12% relative error. These findings show that quantum advantages in strategic coordination can persist under realistic NISQ conditions, providing a pathway toward practical applications of quantum game theory in multi-agent, economic, and distributed decision-making systems.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 06:24:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.09050</guid></item><item><title>Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like
  Priors</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08896</link><description>AffordDex is a two-stage framework that learns a universal grasping policy with motion priors and object affordances, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in dexterous grasping and human-like postures.  					AI-generated summary 				 A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 08:48:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08896</guid></item><item><title>WGAST: Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface
  Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.06485</link><description>WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network, enhances daily 10 m land surface temperature estimation using spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

  General Samples Replay</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.04676</link><description>General Sample Replay (GeRe) framework with threshold-based margin (TM) loss addresses catastrophic forgetting in large language models by maintaining activation state consistency during replay learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

  Modeling with Paralinguistic Vocalizations</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.04195</link><description>NVSpeech is a pipeline that integrates the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations in Mandarin, using a large annotated dataset and models that treat these cues as decodable tokens.  					AI-generated summary 				 Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.
