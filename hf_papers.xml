Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we reduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile devices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly excelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:35:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13923</guid></item><item><title>RAD: Training an End-to-End Driving Policy via Large-Scale 3DGS-based Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13144</link><description>Existing end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) algorithms typically follow the Imitation Learning (IL) paradigm, which faces challenges such as causal confusion and the open-loop gap. In this work, we establish a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigm. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards that guide the policy to effectively respond to safety-critical events and understand real-world causal relationships. For better alignment with human driving behavior, IL is incorporated into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, especially 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented at https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:13:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13144</guid></item><item><title>SongGen: A Single Stage Auto-regressive Transformer for Text-to-Song Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13128</link><description>Text-to-song generation, the task of creating vocals and accompaniment from textual inputs, poses significant challenges due to domain complexity and data scarcity. Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures, resulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we propose SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer designed for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates fine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and textual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also offering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within a unified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed mode, which generates a mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and dual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in downstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each mode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights. Furthermore, we design an automated data preprocessing pipeline with effective quality control. To foster community engagement and future research, we will release our model weights, training code, annotated data, and preprocessing pipeline. The generated samples are showcased on our project page at https://liuzh-19.github.io/SongGen/ , and the code will be available at https://github.com/LiuZH-19/SongGen .</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:07:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13128</guid></item><item><title>MoM: Linear Sequence Modeling with Mixture-of-Memories</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13685</link><description>Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating "memory interference", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 07:40:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13685</guid></item><item><title>Craw4LLM: Efficient Web Crawling for LLM Pretraining</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13347</link><description>Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Crawl4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Crawl4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Crawl4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/Crawl4LLM.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:57:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13347</guid></item><item><title>LongPO: Long Context Self-Evolution of Large Language Models through Short-to-Long Preference Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13922</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities through pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may underperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context alignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality of human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses LLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising paired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs and their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference reveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context alignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios. Additionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate short-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully retains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in both long- and short-context tasks. Specifically, \ourMethod-trained models can achieve results on long-context benchmarks comparable to, or even surpassing, those of superior LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-128K) that involve extensive long-context annotation and larger parameter scales.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 02:35:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13922</guid></item><item><title>Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12143</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models (leq3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 02:38:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12143</guid></item><item><title>Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13965</link><description>Large language model (LLM) applications are evolving beyond simple chatbots into dynamic, general-purpose agentic programs, which scale LLM calls and output tokens to help AI agents reason, explore, and solve complex tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:42:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13965</guid></item><item><title>Presumed Cultural Identity: How Names Shape LLM Responses</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.11995</link><description>Names are deeply tied to human identity. They can serve as markers of individuality, cultural heritage, and personal history. However, using names as a core indicator of identity can lead to over-simplification of complex identities. When interacting with LLMs, user names are an important point of information for personalisation. Names can enter chatbot conversations through direct user input (requested by chatbots), as part of task contexts such as CV reviews, or as built-in memory features that store user information for personalisation. We study biases associated with names by measuring cultural presumptions in the responses generated by LLMs when presented with common suggestion-seeking queries, which might involve making assumptions about the user. Our analyses demonstrate strong assumptions about cultural identity associated with names present in LLM generations across multiple cultures. Our work has implications for designing more nuanced personalisation systems that avoid reinforcing stereotypes while maintaining meaningful customisation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:20:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.11995</guid></item><item><title>Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13946</link><description>The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:54:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13946</guid></item><item><title>SearchRAG: Can Search Engines Be Helpful for LLM-based Medical Question Answering?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13233</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains but often struggle with tasks requiring specialized knowledge. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques typically retrieve external information from static knowledge bases, which can be outdated or incomplete, missing fine-grained clinical details essential for accurate medical question answering. In this work, we propose SearchRAG, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging real-time search engines. Our method employs synthetic query generation to convert complex medical questions into search-engine-friendly queries and utilizes uncertainty-based knowledge selection to filter and incorporate the most relevant and informative medical knowledge into the LLM's input. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves response accuracy in medical question answering tasks, particularly for complex questions requiring detailed and up-to-date knowledge.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:27:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13233</guid></item><item><title>Thinking Preference Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13173</link><description>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has been a go-to and effective method for enhancing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in relatively small LLMs by fine-tuning them with long CoT responses from larger LLMs. To continually improve reasoning abilities, we can either collect new high-quality long CoT reasoning SFT data or repeatedly train on existing SFT datasets. However, acquiring new long CoT SFT data is costly and limited, while repeated training often results in a performance plateau or decline. To further boost the performance with the SFT data, we propose Thinking Preference Optimization (ThinkPO), a simple yet effective post-SFT method that enhances long CoT reasoning without requiring new long CoT responses. Instead, ThinkPO utilizes readily available or easily obtainable short CoT reasoning responses as rejected answers and long CoT responses as chosen answers for the same question. It then applies direct preference optimization to encourage the model to favor longer reasoning outputs. Experiments show that ThinkPO further improves the reasoning performance of SFT-ed models, e.g. it increases math reasoning accuracy of SFT-ed models by 8.6% and output length by 25.9%. Notably, ThinkPO is capable of continually boosting the performance of the publicly distilled SFT model, e.g., increasing the official DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's performance on MATH500 from 87.4% to 91.2%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:31:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13173</guid></item><item><title>Is That Your Final Answer? Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13962</link><description>Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 02:23:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13962</guid></item><item><title>AdaptiveStep: Automatically Dividing Reasoning Step through Model Confidence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13943</link><description>Current approaches for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) often involve breaking down responses into multiple reasoning steps using rule-based techniques, such as using predefined placeholder tokens or setting the reasoning step's length into a fixed size. These approaches overlook the fact that specific words do not typically mark true decision points in a text. To address this, we propose AdaptiveStep, a method that divides reasoning steps based on the model's confidence in predicting the next word. This division method provides more decision-making information at each step, enhancing downstream tasks, such as reward model learning. Moreover, our method does not require manual annotation. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with AdaptiveStep-trained PRMs in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Experimental results indicate that the outcome PRM achieves state-of-the-art Best-of-N performance, surpassing greedy search strategy with token-level value-guided decoding, while also reducing construction costs by over 30% compared to existing open-source PRMs. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis and case study on the PRM's performance, transferability, and generalization capabilities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:07:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13943</guid></item><item><title>REFIND: Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13622</link><description>Hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs severely limit their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. To address this challenge, we introduce REFIND (Retrieval-augmented Factuality hallucINation Detection), a novel framework that detects hallucinated spans within LLM outputs by directly leveraging retrieved documents. As part of the REFIND, we propose the Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR), a novel metric that quantifies the sensitivity of LLM outputs to retrieved evidence. This innovative approach enables REFIND to efficiently and accurately detect hallucinations, setting it apart from existing methods. In the evaluation, REFIND demonstrated robustness across nine languages, including low-resource settings, and significantly outperformed baseline models, achieving superior IoU scores in identifying hallucinated spans. This work highlights the effectiveness of quantifying context sensitivity for hallucination detection, thereby paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications across diverse languages.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:25:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13622</guid></item><item><title>NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12638</link><description>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design. While prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling continuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based Language Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the billion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule generation, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively pretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts the generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning. Notably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in distributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model achieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements in 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD for de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for conditional 3D generation on QM9-2014. Our codes and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/acharkq/NExT-Mol.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:18:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12638</guid></item><item><title>ActionPiece: Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences for Generative Recommendation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13581</link><description>Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item features, which serve as the initial tokens. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@10 by 6.00% to 12.82%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13581</guid></item><item><title>Train Small, Infer Large: Memory-Efficient LoRA Training for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13533</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing with exceptional task generalization capabilities. Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) offers a cost-effective fine-tuning solution, freezing the original model parameters and training only lightweight, low-rank adapter matrices. However, the memory footprint of LoRA is largely dominated by the original model parameters. To mitigate this, we propose LoRAM, a memory-efficient LoRA training scheme founded on the intuition that many neurons in over-parameterized LLMs have low training utility but are essential for inference. LoRAM presents a unique twist: it trains on a pruned (small) model to obtain pruned low-rank matrices, which are then recovered and utilized with the original (large) model for inference. Additionally, minimal-cost continual pre-training, performed by the model publishers in advance, aligns the knowledge discrepancy between pruned and original models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LoRAM across various pruning strategies and downstream tasks. For a model with 70 billion parameters, LoRAM enables training on a GPU with only 20G HBM, replacing an A100-80G GPU for LoRA training and 15 GPUs for full fine-tuning. Specifically, QLoRAM implemented by structured pruning combined with 4-bit quantization, for LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B), reduces the parameter storage cost that dominates the memory usage in low-rank matrix training by 15.81times (16.95times), while achieving dominant performance gains over both the original LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B) and LoRA-trained LLaMA-3.1-8B (LLaMA-2-13B).</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:45:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13533</guid></item><item><title>GIMMICK -- Globally Inclusive Multimodal Multitask Cultural Knowledge Benchmarking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13766</link><description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently gained attention due to their distinctive performance and broad applicability. While it has been previously shown that their efficacy in usage scenarios involving non-Western contexts falls short, existing studies are limited in scope, covering just a narrow range of cultures, focusing exclusively on a small number of cultural aspects, or evaluating a limited selection of models on a single task only. Towards globally inclusive LVLM research, we introduce GIMMICK, an extensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess a broad spectrum of cultural knowledge across 144 countries representing six global macro-regions. GIMMICK comprises six tasks built upon three new datasets that span 728 unique cultural events or facets on which we evaluated 20 LVLMs and 11 LLMs, including five proprietary and 26 open-weight models of all sizes. We systematically examine (1) regional cultural biases, (2) the influence of model size, (3) input modalities, and (4) external cues. Our analyses reveal strong biases toward Western cultures across models and tasks and highlight strong correlations between model size and performance, as well as the effectiveness of multimodal input and external geographic cues. We further find that models have more knowledge of tangible than intangible aspects (e.g., food vs. rituals) and that they excel in recognizing broad cultural origins but struggle with a more nuanced understanding.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:19:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13766</guid></item><item><title>InfiR : Crafting Effective Small Language Models and Multimodal Small Language Models in Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.11573</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in reasoning capabilities.

Moreover, there is no one-to-one correspondence between source and target samples. Although various SHDA methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the nature of the knowledge transferred across heterogeneous domains remains unclear. This paper delves into this question from an empirical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on about 330 SHDA tasks, employing two supervised learning methods and seven representative SHDA methods. Surprisingly, our observations indicate that both the category and feature information of source samples do not significantly impact the performance of the target domain. Additionally, noise drawn from simple distributions, when used as source samples, may contain transferable knowledge. Based on this insight, we perform a series of experiments to uncover the underlying principles of transferable knowledge in SHDA. Specifically, we design a unified Knowledge Transfer Framework (KTF) for SHDA. Based on the KTF, we find that the transferable knowledge in SHDA primarily stems from the transferability and discriminability of the source domain. Consequently, ensuring those properties in source samples, regardless of their origin (e.g., image, text, noise), can enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in SHDA tasks.
