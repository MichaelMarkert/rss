AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:57:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04705</guid></item><item><title>FASA: Frequency-aware Sparse Attention</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03152</link><description>FASA is a novel framework that uses query-aware token eviction and functional sparsity in RoPE to reduce KV cache memory usage while maintaining high performance in long-context LLM tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck when handling lengthy inputs: the prohibitive memory footprint of the Key Value (KV) cache. To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of "dominant" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56times speedup using just 18.9\% of the cache on AIME24.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:45:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03152</guid></item><item><title>Training Data Efficiency in Multimodal Process Reward Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04145</link><description>Training multimodal process reward models efficiently through balanced-information scoring that prioritizes label mixture and reliability while achieving full-data performance with only 10% of training data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:51:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04145</guid></item><item><title>WideSeek-R1: Exploring Width Scaling for Broad Information Seeking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04634</link><description>Multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning enable parallel information seeking with scalable orchestration, achieving performance comparable to larger single agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04634</guid></item><item><title>OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04804</link><description>OmniSIFT is a modality-asymmetric token compression framework for Omni-LLMs that reduces computational overhead through spatio-temporal video pruning and vision-guided audio selection while maintaining superior performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:18:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04804</guid></item><item><title>HySparse: A Hybrid Sparse Attention Architecture with Oracle Token Selection and KV Cache Sharing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03560</link><description>Hybrid Sparse Attention architecture interleaves full and sparse attention layers, using full attention output to guide sparse layer token selection and cache reuse for improved efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:48:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03560</guid></item><item><title>EgoActor: Grounding Task Planning into Spatial-aware Egocentric Actions for Humanoid Robots via Visual-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04515</link><description>EgoActor is a unified vision-language model that translates high-level instructions into precise humanoid robot actions through integrated perception and execution across simulated and real-world environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04515</guid></item><item><title>Quant VideoGen: Auto-Regressive Long Video Generation via 2-Bit KV-Cache Quantization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02958</link><description>Quant VideoGen addresses KV cache memory limitations in autoregressive video diffusion models through semantic-aware smoothing and progressive residual quantization, achieving significant memory reduction with minimal latency impact.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:10:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02958</guid></item><item><title>SoMA: A Real-to-Sim Neural Simulator for Robotic Soft-body Manipulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02402</link><description>SoMA is a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator that enables stable, long-horizon manipulation of soft bodies by coupling deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot actions in a unified latent neural space.  					AI-generated summary 				 Simulating deformable objects under rich interactions remains a fundamental challenge for real-to-sim robot manipulation, with dynamics jointly driven by environmental effects and robot actions. Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models. SoMA improves resimulation accuracy and generalization on real-world robot manipulation by 20%, enabling stable simulation of complex tasks such as long-horizon cloth folding.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:37:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02402</guid></item><item><title>TIDE: Trajectory-based Diagnostic Evaluation of Test-Time Improvement in LLM Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02196</link><description>Test-Time Improvement (TTI) in autonomous LLM agents involves iterative environmental interaction that enhances performance, but current evaluation methods inadequately capture task optimization efficiency and memory utilization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:47:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02196</guid></item><item><title>Semantic Routing: Exploring Multi-Layer LLM Feature Weighting for Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03510</link><description>Text conditioning in DiT-based models is enhanced through a unified normalized convex fusion framework that optimizes multi-layer LLM hidden states via depth-wise semantic routing, improving text-image alignment and compositional generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 06:15:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03510</guid></item><item><title>Residual Context Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.22954</link><description>Residual Context Diffusion (RCD) enhances diffusion large language models by recycling discarded token information through contextual residuals, improving accuracy with minimal computational overhead.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a "remasking" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:18:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.22954</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking the Trust Region in LLM Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04879</link><description>DPPO addresses limitations in PPO for LLM fine-tuning by replacing ratio clipping with direct policy divergence constraints, improving training stability and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:33:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04879</guid></item><item><title>HY3D-Bench: Generation of 3D Assets</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03907</link><description>HY3D-Bench presents an open-source ecosystem for 3D content creation that provides high-fidelity 3D objects and synthetic assets to advance 3D generation capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent advances in neural representations and generative models have revolutionized 3D content creation, the field remains constrained by significant data processing bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce HY3D-Bench, an open-source ecosystem designed to establish a unified, high-quality foundation for 3D generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We curate a library of 250k high-fidelity 3D objects distilled from large-scale repositories, employing a rigorous pipeline to deliver training-ready artifacts, including watertight meshes and multi-view renderings; (2) We introduce structured part-level decomposition, providing the granularity essential for fine-grained perception and controllable editing; and (3) We bridge real-world distribution gaps via a scalable AIGC synthesis pipeline, contributing 125k synthetic assets to enhance diversity in long-tail categories. Validated empirically through the training of Hunyuan3D-2.1-Small, HY3D-Bench democratizes access to robust data resources, aiming to catalyze innovation across 3D perception, robotics, and digital content creation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:37:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03907</guid></item><item><title>AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03828</link><description>FigureBench presents the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts, while AutoFigure introduces an agentic framework that produces publication-ready illustrations through extensive thinking, recombination, and validation processes.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:36:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03828</guid></item><item><title>Self-Hinting Language Models Enhance Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03143</link><description>SAGE is an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that enhances GRPO by injecting self-hints during training to increase outcome diversity under sparse rewards, improving alignment of large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt x, the model samples a compact hint h (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution τ conditioned on (x,h). Crucially, the task reward R(x,τ) is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set h=varnothing and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

AI-generated summary 				 For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the Vibe AIGC, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.   Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:14:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04575</guid></item><item><title>A-RAG: Scaling Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Hierarchical Retrieval Interfaces</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03442</link><description>Agentic RAG framework enables models to dynamically adapt retrieval decisions across multiple granularities, outperforming traditional approaches while scaling efficiently with model improvements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Frontier language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and long-horizon tool-use capabilities. However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research. Code and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/arag.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03442</guid></item><item><title>CL-bench: A Benchmark for Context Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03587</link><description>Language models struggle with context learning, requiring new knowledge and reasoning beyond pre-training, as demonstrated by a comprehensive benchmark revealing poor performance on real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:37:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03587</guid></item><item><title>VLS: Steering Pretrained Robot Policies via Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03973</link><description>Pretrained diffusion and flow-matching policies fail under test-time shifts due to tight coupling with training configurations, prompting the development of Vision-Language Steering (VLS) for training-free inference-time adaptation through vision-language model-guided trajectory steering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

AI-generated summary 				 Search agents are language models (LMs) that reason and search knowledge bases (or the web) to answer questions; recent methods supervise only the final answer accuracy using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Most RLVR search agents tackle general-domain QA, which limits their relevance to technical AI systems in science, engineering, and medicine. In this work we propose training agents to search and reason over scientific papers -- this tests technical question-answering, it is directly relevant to real scientists, and the capabilities will be crucial to future AI Scientist systems. Concretely, we release a search corpus of 16 million biomedical paper abstracts and construct a challenging factoid QA dataset called PaperSearchQA with 60k samples answerable from the corpus, along with benchmarks. We train search agents in this environment to outperform non-RL retrieval baselines; we also perform further quantitative analysis and observe interesting agent behaviors like planning, reasoning, and self-verification. Our corpus, datasets, and benchmarks are usable with the popular Search-R1 codebase for RLVR training and released on https://huggingface.co/collections/jmhb/papersearchqa. Finally, our data creation methods are scalable and easily extendable to other scientific domains.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 04:54:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.18207</guid></item><item><title>MEnvAgent: Scalable Polyglot Environment Construction for Verifiable Software Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.22859</link><description>MEnvAgent is a multi-language framework that automates environment construction for software engineering tasks using a planning-execution-verification architecture and environment reuse mechanism, achieving improved performance on a new benchmark and creating the largest open-source polyglot dataset of verifiable Docker environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for software engineering (SWE) is constrained by the scarcity of verifiable datasets, a bottleneck stemming from the complexity of constructing executable environments across diverse languages. To address this, we introduce MEnvAgent, a Multi-language framework for automated Environment construction that facilitates scalable generation of verifiable task instances. MEnvAgent employs a multi-agent Planning-Execution-Verification architecture to autonomously resolve construction failures and integrates a novel Environment Reuse Mechanism that reduces computational overhead by incrementally patching historical environments. Evaluations on MEnvBench, a new benchmark comprising 1,000 tasks across 10 languages, demonstrate that MEnvAgent outperforms baselines, improving Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rates by 8.6% while reducing time costs by 43%. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of MEnvAgent by constructing MEnvData-SWE, the largest open-source polyglot dataset of realistic verifiable Docker environments to date, alongside solution trajectories that enable consistent performance gains on SWE tasks across a wide range of models.

AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:06:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04735</guid></item><item><title>D-CORE: Incentivizing Task Decomposition in Large Reasoning Models for Complex Tool Use</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02160</link><description>A two-stage training framework called D-CORE is proposed to improve large reasoning models' ability to decompose complex tasks and compose reasoning processes, achieving superior performance in tool-use benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective tool use and reasoning are essential capabilities for large reasoning models~(LRMs) to address complex real-world problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that current LRMs lack the capability of sub-task decomposition in complex tool use scenarios, leading to Lazy Reasoning. To address this, we propose a two-stage training framework D-CORE~(\textbf{D}ecomposing tasks and \textbf{Co}mposing \textbf{Re}asoning processes) that first incentivize the LRMs' task decomposition reasoning capability via self-distillation, followed by diversity-aware reinforcement learning~(RL) to restore LRMs' reflective reasoning capability. D-CORE achieves robust tool-use improvements across diverse benchmarks and model scales. Experiments on BFCLv3 demonstrate superiority of our method: D-CORE-8B reaches 77.7\% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing 8B model by 5.7\%. Meanwhile, D-CORE-14B establishes a new state-of-the-art at 79.3\%, outperforming 70B models despite being 5times smaller.

AI-generated summary 				 Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

AI-generated summary 				 The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2times higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:15:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04816</guid></item><item><title>BatCoder: Self-Supervised Bidirectional Code-Documentation Learning via Back-Translation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02554</link><description>BatCoder is a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes code and documentation generation through back-translation, achieving superior performance on code-related benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training LLMs for code-related tasks typically depends on high-quality code-documentation pairs, which are costly to curate and often scarce for niche programming languages. We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:31:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02554</guid></item><item><title>SpatiaLab: Can Vision-Language Models Perform Spatial Reasoning in the Wild?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03916</link><description>SpatiaLab presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' spatial reasoning capabilities across realistic, diverse scenarios, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth &amp; Occlusion, Orientation, Size &amp; Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

AI-generated summary 				 Current embodied VLM evaluation relies on static, expert-defined, manually annotated benchmarks that exhibit severe redundancy and coverage imbalance. This labor intensive paradigm drains computational and annotation resources, inflates costs, and distorts model rankings, ultimately stifling iterative development. To address this, we propose Agentic Automatic Evaluation (A2Eval), the first agentic framework that automates benchmark curation and evaluation through two collaborative agents. The Data Agent autonomously induces capability dimensions and assembles a balanced, compact evaluation suite, while the Eval Agent synthesizes and validates executable evaluation pipelines, enabling fully autonomous, high-fidelity assessment. Evaluated across 10 benchmarks and 13 models, A2Eval compresses evaluation suites by 85%, reduces overall computational costs by 77%, and delivers a 4.6x speedup while preserving evaluation quality. Crucially, A2Eval corrects systematic ranking biases, improves human alignment to Spearman's rho=0.85, and maintains high ranking fidelity (Kendall's tau=0.81), establishing a new standard for high-fidelity, low-cost embodied assessment. Our code and data will be public soon.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:50:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.01640</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Unimodal Shortcuts: MLLMs as Cross-Modal Reasoners for Grounded Named Entity Recognition</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04486</link><description>MLLMs suffer from modality bias in GMNER tasks, which is addressed through a proposed method that enforces cross-modal reasoning via multi-style reasoning schema injection and constraint-guided verifiable optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit modality bias, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning (MCR), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:40:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04486</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying the Gap between Understanding and Generation within Unified Multimodal Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02140</link><description>Unified multimodal models exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation capabilities, indicating only surface-level integration rather than deep cognitive convergence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMM) have demonstrated remarkable progress in both understanding and generation tasks. However, whether these two capabilities are genuinely aligned and integrated within a single model remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two "unified" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:38:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02140</guid></item><item><title>Likelihood-Based Reward Designs for General LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03979</link><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 14:06:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.03979</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion with Dummy Head</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.20499</link><description>Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from inefficient attention mechanisms that underutilize historical frames, but a new method called Dummy Forcing improves efficiency through heterogeneous memory allocation and dynamic head programming while maintaining quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

AI-generated summary 				 The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04805</guid></item><item><title>No One-Size-Fits-All: Building Systems For Translation to Bashkir, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tatar and Chuvash Using Synthetic And Original Data</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04442</link><description>Machine translation experiments for Turkic languages using nllb-200, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt-based approaches achieved varying chrF++ scores across language pairs.

AI-generated summary 				 Multi-Agent Discussion (MAD) has garnered increasing attention very recently, where multiple LLM instances collaboratively solve problems via structured discussion. However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control. The results show that the performance of M2CL significantly surpasses existing methods by 20%--50%, while enjoying favorable transferability and computational efficiency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:52:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02350</guid></item><item><title>Protein Autoregressive Modeling via Multiscale Structure Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04883</link><description>PAR is a multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation that uses hierarchical structure modeling, autoregressive transformers, and flow-based decoding to produce high-quality protein structures with improved generalization and reduced exposure bias.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04883</guid></item><item><title>SAFE: Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-Aware Predictive Control for RLHF</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04651</link><description>A new reinforcement learning algorithm for language model alignment that improves stability and performance over PPO through enhanced KL divergence control and adaptive reward management.  					AI-generated summary 				 Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

AI-generated summary 				 Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:04:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04605</guid></item><item><title>Proxy Compression for Language Modeling</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04289</link><description>Proxy compression trains language models on both raw byte sequences and compressed views, enabling efficient training with end-to-end raw-byte inference while maintaining model robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:16:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04289</guid></item><item><title>SkeletonGaussian: Editable 4D Generation through Gaussian Skeletonization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04271</link><description>SkeletonGaussian enables editable 4D generation by decomposing motion into rigid skeleton-driven and non-rigid fine-grained components using hexplane-based refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

AI-generated summary 				 We present LongVPO, a novel two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to robustly understand ultra-long videos without any long-video annotations. In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:05:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.02341</guid></item><item><title>Self-Rewarding Sequential Monte Carlo for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.01849</link><description>Self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo enables effective sampling of masked diffusion language models by using parallel diffusion processes and trajectory-level confidence signals to improve generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an inference-time scaling algorithm enabling effective sampling of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/self-rewarding-smc.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.01849</guid></item><item><title>OmniRad: A Radiological Foundation Model for Multi-Task Medical Image Analysis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04547</link><description>OmniRad is a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images that demonstrates improved performance in classification and segmentation tasks through representation reuse and cross-task transferability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Radiological analysis increasingly benefits from pretrained visual representations that can support heterogeneous downstream tasks across imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce OmniRad, a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images, designed with radiology-inspired principles emphasizing representation reuse and cross-task transferability. We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations. Qualitative analyses and latent-space visualizations suggest improved feature clustering and modality-related separation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04547</guid></item></channel></rss>
