  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07365</link><description>We present MM-Eureka, a multimodal reasoning model that successfully extends large-scale &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; to multimodal reasoning. While rule-based RL has shown remarkable success in improving LLMs' reasoning abilities in text domains, its application to multimodal settings has remained challenging. Our work reproduces key characteristics of text-based RL systems like DeepSeek-R1 in the multimodal space, including steady increases in accuracy reward and response length, and the emergence of reflection behaviors. We demonstrate that both instruction-tuned and pre-trained models can develop strong &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;multimodal reasoning capabilities&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; through rule-based RL without supervised fine-tuning, showing superior data efficiency compared to alternative approaches.

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation. The code and project website are available at: https://github.com/showlab/MovieAgent and https://weijiawu.github.io/MovieAgent.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:00:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07314</guid></item><item><title>FedRand: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with Randomized LoRA
  Subparameter Updates</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07216</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;client parameters&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:01:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07216</guid></item><item><title>DistiLLM-2: A Contrastive Approach Boosts the Distillation of LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07067</link><description>Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:03:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07067</guid></item><item><title>Taking Notes Brings Focus? Towards Multi-Turn Multimodal Dialogue
  Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07002</link><description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:06:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07002</guid></item><item><title>SEAP: Training-free Sparse Expert Activation Pruning Unlock the
  Brainpower of Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07605</link><description>Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks, yet their high computational cost during inference remains a major bottleneck. This paper introduces Sparse Expert Activation Pruning (SEAP), a training-free pruning method that selectively retains task-relevant parameters to reduce inference overhead. Inspired by the clustering patterns of hidden states and activations in LLMs, SEAP identifies task-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving task performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, at 50% pruning, SEAP surpasses both WandA and FLAP by over 20%, and at 20% pruning, it incurs only a 2.2% performance drop compared to the dense model. These findings highlight SEAP's scalability and effectiveness, making it a promising approach for optimizing large-scale LLMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:51:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07605</guid></item><item><title>FEA-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Repository-Level Code Generation
  for Feature Implementation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06680</link><description>Implementing new features in repository-level codebases is a crucial application of code generation models. However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 01:43:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06680</guid></item><item><title>EasyControl: Adding Efficient and Flexible Control for Diffusion
  Transformer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07027</link><description>Recent advancements in Unet-based diffusion models, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, have introduced effective spatial and subject control mechanisms. However, the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture still struggles with efficient and flexible control. To tackle this issue, we propose EasyControl, a novel framework designed to unify condition-guided diffusion transformers with high efficiency and flexibility. Our framework is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce a lightweight &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;Condition Injection LoRA Module&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. This module processes conditional signals in isolation, acting as a plug-and-play solution. It avoids modifying the base model weights, ensuring compatibility with customized models and enabling the flexible injection of diverse conditions. Notably, this module also supports harmonious and robust zero-shot multi-condition generalization, even when trained only on single-condition data. Second, we propose a &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;Position-Aware Training Paradigm&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. This approach standardizes input conditions to fixed resolutions, allowing the generation of images with arbitrary aspect ratios and flexible resolutions. At the same time, it optimizes computational efficiency, making the framework more practical for real-world applications. Third, we develop a Causal Attention Mechanism combined with the KV Cache technique, adapted for conditional generation tasks. This innovation significantly reduces the latency of image synthesis, improving the overall efficiency of the framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EasyControl achieves exceptional performance across various application scenarios. These innovations collectively make our framework highly efficient, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of tasks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 01:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07027</guid></item><item><title>LLaVE: Large Language and Vision Embedding Models with Hardness-Weighted
  Contrastive Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04812</link><description>Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 04:04:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04812</guid></item><item><title>Agent models: Internalizing Chain-of-Action Generation into Reasoning
  models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06580</link><description>Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position Large Agent Models (LAMs) that internalize the generation of Chain-of-Action (CoA), enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.

  Reinforcement Learning and Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07608</link><description>OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 achieve or even surpass human expert-level performance in complex domains like mathematics and science, with reinforcement learning (RL) and reasoning playing a crucial role. In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning and employs a two-stage planning &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;reasoning training strategy&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; that combines SFT with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning into autonomous driving. Code will be released to facilitate future research.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:07:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07608</guid></item><item><title>DreamRelation: Relation-Centric Video Customization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07602</link><description>Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos that depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for comprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code and models will be made publicly available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:50:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07602</guid></item><item><title>PE3R: Perception-Efficient 3D Reconstruction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07507</link><description>Recent advancements in 2D-to-3D perception have significantly improved the understanding of 3D scenes from 2D images. However, existing methods face critical challenges, including limited generalization across scenes, suboptimal perception accuracy, and slow reconstruction speeds. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Efficient 3D Reconstruction (PE3R), a novel framework designed to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. PE3R employs a feed-forward architecture to enable rapid 3D semantic field reconstruction. The framework demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across diverse scenes and objects while significantly improving reconstruction speed. Extensive experiments on 2D-to-3D open-vocabulary segmentation and 3D reconstruction validate the effectiveness and versatility of PE3R. The framework achieves a minimum 9-fold speedup in 3D semantic field reconstruction, along with substantial gains in perception accuracy and reconstruction precision, setting new benchmarks in the field. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hujiecpp/PE3R.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:48:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07507</guid></item><item><title>Seg-Zero: Reasoning-Chain Guided Segmentation via Cognitive
  Reinforcement</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06520</link><description>Traditional methods for reasoning segmentation rely on supervised fine-tuning with categorical labels and simple descriptions, limiting its out-of-domain generalization and lacking explicit reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-Zero, a novel framework that demonstrates remarkable generalizability and derives explicit chain-of-thought reasoning through cognitive reinforcement. Seg-Zero introduces a decoupled architecture consisting of a reasoning model and a segmentation model. The reasoning model interprets user intentions, generates explicit reasoning chains, and produces positional prompts, which are subsequently used by the segmentation model to generate precious pixel-level masks. We design a sophisticated reward mechanism that integrates both format and accuracy rewards to effectively guide optimization directions. Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Seg-Zero achieves robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that Seg-Zero-7B achieves a zero-shot performance of 57.5 on the ReasonSeg benchmark, surpassing the prior LISA-7B by 18\%. This significant improvement highlights Seg-Zero's ability to generalize across domains while presenting an explicit reasoning process. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Seg-Zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:08:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06520</guid></item><item><title>BlackGoose Rimer: Harnessing RWKV-7 as a Simple yet Superior Replacement
  for Transformers in Large-Scale Time Series Modeling</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06121</link><description>Time series models face significant challenges in scaling to handle large and complex datasets, akin to the scaling achieved by large language models (LLMs). The unique characteristics of time series data and the computational demands of model scaling necessitate innovative approaches. While researchers have explored various architectures such as Transformers, LSTMs, and GRUs to address these challenges, we propose a novel solution using RWKV-7, which incorporates meta-learning into its state update mechanism. By integrating RWKV-7's time mix and channel mix components into the transformer-based time series model Timer, we achieve a substantial performance improvement of approximately 1.13 to 43.3x and a 4.5x reduction in training time with 1/23 parameters, all while utilizing fewer parameters. Our code and model weights are publicly available for further research and development at https://github.com/Alic-Li/BlackGoose_Rimer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:48:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06121</guid></item><item><title>Effective and Efficient Masked Image Generation Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07197</link><description>Although masked image generation models and masked diffusion models are designed with different motivations and objectives, we observe that they can be unified within a single framework. Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512x512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:02:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07197</guid></item><item><title>Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large
  Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06749</link><description>DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of sim6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:04:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06749</guid></item><item><title>State-offset Tuning: State-based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for
  State Space Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03499</link><description>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers, mitigating their quadratic computational cost. However, the application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to SSMs remains largely unexplored. In particular, prompt-based methods like Prompt Tuning and Prefix-Tuning, which are widely used in Transformers, do not perform well on SSMs. To address this, we propose state-based methods as a superior alternative to prompt-based methods. This new family of methods naturally stems from the architectural characteristics of SSMs. State-based methods adjust state-related features directly instead of depending on external prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel state-based PEFT method: State-offset Tuning. At every timestep, our method directly affects the state at the current step, leading to more effective adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/ssm-state-tuning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 01:47:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03499</guid></item><item><title>Should VLMs be Pre-trained with Image Data?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07603</link><description>Pre-trained LLMs that are further trained with image data perform well on vision-language tasks. While adding images during a second training phase effectively unlocks this capability, it is unclear how much of a gain or loss this two-step pipeline gives over VLMs which integrate images earlier into the training process. To investigate this, we train models spanning various datasets, scales, image-text ratios, and amount of pre-training done before introducing vision tokens. We then fine-tune these models and evaluate their downstream performance on a suite of vision-language and text-only tasks. We find that pre-training with a mixture of image and text data allows models to perform better on vision-language tasks while maintaining strong performance on text-only evaluations. On an average of 6 diverse tasks, we find that for a 1B model, introducing visual tokens 80% of the way through pre-training results in a 2% average improvement over introducing visual tokens to a fully pre-trained model.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 05:00:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07603</guid></item><item><title>Detection Avoidance Techniques for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07595</link><description>The increasing popularity of large language models has not only led to widespread use but has also brought various risks, including the potential for systematically spreading fake news. Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vulnerable to evasion techniques, as demonstrated in an experimental series: Systematic changes of the generative models' temperature proofed shallow learning-detectors to be the least reliable. Fine-tuning the generative model via reinforcement learning circumvented BERT-based-detectors. Finally, rephrasing led to a &gt;90\% evasion of zero-shot-detectors like DetectGPT, although texts stayed highly similar to the original. A comparison with existing work highlights the better performance of the presented methods. Possible implications for society and further research are discussed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:49:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07595</guid></item><item><title>ProBench: Judging Multimodal Foundation Models on Open-ended
  Multi-domain Expert Tasks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06885</link><description>Solving expert-level multimodal tasks is a key milestone towards general intelligence. As the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to improve, evaluation of such advanced multimodal intelligence becomes necessary yet challenging. In this work, we introduce ProBench, a benchmark of open-ended user queries that require professional expertise and advanced reasoning. ProBench consists of 4,000 high-quality samples independently submitted by professionals based on their daily productivity demands. It spans across 10 fields and 56 sub-&lt;PRE_TAG&gt;fields&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;, including science, arts, humanities, coding, mathematics, and creative writing. Experimentally, we evaluate and compare 24 latest models using MLLM-as-a-Judge. Our results reveal that although the best open-source models rival the proprietary ones, ProBench presents significant challenges in visual perception, textual understanding, domain knowledge and advanced reasoning, thus providing valuable directions for future multimodal AI research efforts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:54:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06885</guid></item><item><title>Words or Vision: Do Vision-Language Models Have Blind Faith in Text?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.02199</link><description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a ``blind faith in text'' phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 01:42:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.02199</guid></item><item><title>SurveyForge: On the Outline Heuristics, Memory-Driven Generation, and
  Multi-dimensional Evaluation for Automated Survey Writing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04629</link><description>Survey paper plays a crucial role in scientific research, especially given the rapid growth of research publications. Recently, researchers have begun using LLMs to automate survey generation for better efficiency. However, the quality gap between LLM-generated surveys and those written by human remains significant, particularly in terms of outline quality and citation accuracy. To close these gaps, we introduce SurveyForge, which first generates the outline by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SurveyForge can automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article. Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality. Experiments demonstrate that SurveyForge can outperform previous works such as AutoSurvey.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:23:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04629</guid></item><item><title>NeuGrasp: Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction with Background
  Priors for Material-Agnostic Object Grasp Detection</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03511</link><description>Robotic grasping in scenes with transparent and specular objects presents great challenges for methods relying on accurate depth information. In this paper, we introduce NeuGrasp, a neural surface reconstruction method that leverages background priors for material-agnostic grasp detection. NeuGrasp integrates transformers and global prior volumes to aggregate multi-view features with spatial encoding, enabling robust surface reconstruction in narrow and sparse viewing conditions. By focusing on foreground objects through residual feature enhancement and refining spatial perception with an occupancy-prior volume, NeuGrasp excels in handling objects with transparent and specular surfaces. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world scenarios show that NeuGrasp outperforms state-of-the-art methods in grasping while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality.
