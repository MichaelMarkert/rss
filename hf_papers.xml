Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot
  Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01068</link><description>General Policy Composition (GPC) enhances robotic control performance by combining pre-trained diffusion-based policies without additional training, leading to superior results across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:05:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01068</guid></item><item><title>Self-Improvement in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02665</link><description>A survey of self-improvement methods in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) from data collection, organization, and model optimization perspectives.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs, particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 01:40:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02665</guid></item><item><title>REPAIR: Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
  Reintegration</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01879</link><description>REPAIR is a lifelong editing framework for large language models that enhances editing accuracy and reduces knowledge forgetting through progressive adaptive intervention and reintegration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management. Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects. Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting. This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:20:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01879</guid></item><item><title>Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-evolving LLM Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.26354</link><description>Self-evolving agents based on Large Language Models can deviate in unintended ways, leading to various risks such as safety misalignment and vulnerability introduction, necessitating new safety paradigms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents.

  Web Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03204</link><description>FocusAgent uses a lightweight LLM retriever to extract relevant content from web page observations, improving efficiency and security in web agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:04:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03204</guid></item><item><title>SurveyBench: How Well Can LLM(-Agents) Write Academic Surveys?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03120</link><description>A new evaluation framework, SurveyBench, assesses the quality of automatically generated academic surveys using a quiz-driven approach, revealing deficiencies in current LLM4Survey methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a. LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys; (2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g., coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs. Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches (e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:00:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03120</guid></item><item><title>Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03230</link><description>Explicit coordinate markers and improved spatial encoding enhance GUI grounding accuracy across diverse resolutions and platforms.  					AI-generated summary 				 GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training. Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally, addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 01:42:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03230</guid></item><item><title>SpineBench: A Clinically Salient, Level-Aware Benchmark Powered by the
  SpineMed-450k Corpus</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03160</link><description>SpineMed, an ecosystem with SpineMed-450k and SpineBench, addresses the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets and benchmarks for AI-assisted diagnosis of spine disorders, improving model performance through fine-grained, level-specific reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:28:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.03160</guid></item><item><title>How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their
  Uncertainty</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02571</link><description>A framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models is introduced, including a metric for calibration, a black-box method called S-QUBED, and a benchmark dataset, demonstrating improved uncertainty estimates and task accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities, spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 01:46:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02571</guid></item><item><title>LSPO: Length-aware Dynamic Sampling for Policy Optimization in LLM
  Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01459</link><description>Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO) is a meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data based on response length, improving learning effectiveness in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 04:36:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01459</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models via Progressive Consistency
  Distillation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00515</link><description>EPIC, a progressive learning framework, improves the efficiency of multi-modal large models by reducing training difficulty through token and layer consistency distillation during visual token compression.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework. Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 05:14:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00515</guid></item><item><title>Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without
  Preference Image Pairs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.25771</link><description>A new framework, Text Preference Optimization (TPO), aligns text-to-image models with human preferences without requiring paired image preference data, improving text-to-image alignment and human preference scores.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods, however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables "free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment.
