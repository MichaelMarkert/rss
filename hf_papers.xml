AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

  Learning to Reason</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22653</link><description>LLMs exhibit robustness to reward noise during post-training and achieve high performance using reasoning pattern rewards (RPR) in conjunction with noisy reward models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.

  Videos</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23693</link><description>A new benchmark, VF-Eval, evaluates the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting AI-generated content videos across four tasks, highlighting challenges and demonstrating benefits in video generation through human feedback alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently. However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt, demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit video generation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 01:54:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23693</guid></item><item><title>Spatial-MLLM: Boosting MLLM Capabilities in Visual-based Spatial
  Intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23747</link><description>Spatial-MLLM improves spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models using a dual-encoder architecture with pretrained 2D and 3D structure encoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual spatial tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:34:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23621</guid></item><item><title>Satori-SWE: Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling for Sample-Efficient Software
  Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23604</link><description>EvoScale, an evolutionary and reinforcement learning-based method, enhances small language models' performance on real-world software engineering tasks by iteratively improving and refining outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one. Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:13:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23604</guid></item><item><title>AnySplat: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting from Unconstrained Views</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23716</link><description>AnySplat is a feed forward network that performs novel view synthesis without camera poses, using 3D Gaussian primitives and unified design for efficiency and quality across sparse and dense datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce AnySplat, a feed forward network for novel view synthesis from uncalibrated image collections. In contrast to traditional neural rendering pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views, our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing real time novel view synthesis within reach for unconstrained capture settings.Project page: https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:12:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23716</guid></item><item><title>UniRL: Self-Improving Unified Multimodal Models via Supervised and
  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23380</link><description>UniRL is a self-improving post-training method for unified multimodal large language models that uses generated images as training data, enhancing both generation and understanding tasks without external data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal large language models such as Show-o and Janus have achieved strong performance across both generation and understanding tasks. However, these models typically rely on large-scale datasets and require substantial computation during the pretraining stage. In addition, several post-training methods have been proposed, but they often depend on external data or are limited to task-specific customization. In this work, we introduce UniRL, a self-improving post-training approach. Our approach enables the model to generate images from prompts and use them as training data in each iteration, without relying on any external image data. Moreover, it enables the two tasks to enhance each other: the generated images are used for understanding, and the understanding results are used to supervise generation. We explore supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the models. UniRL offers three key advantages: (1) it requires no external image data, as all training samples are generated by the model itself during training; (2) it not only improves individual task performance, but also reduces the imbalance between generation and understanding; and (3) it requires only several additional training steps during the post-training stage. We evaluate UniRL on top of Show-o and Janus, achieving a GenEval score of 0.77 for Show-o and 0.65 for Janus. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/showlab/UniRL.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 04:11:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23380</guid></item><item><title>VideoReasonBench: Can MLLMs Perform Vision-Centric Complex Video
  Reasoning?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23359</link><description>A new benchmark, VideoReasonBench, evaluates complex vision-centric video reasoning, finding that extended thinking budgets are crucial for improved performance compared to existing benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric, complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning, e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks, is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:33:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23359</guid></item><item><title>Muddit: Liberating Generation Beyond Text-to-Image with a Unified
  Discrete Diffusion Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23606</link><description>Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer, achieves fast and high-quality generation across text and image modalities by integrating pretrained visual priors with a lightweight text decoder.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:36:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23606</guid></item><item><title>On-Policy RL with Optimal Reward Baseline</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23585</link><description>A novel reinforcement learning algorithm, OPO, improves training stability and performance in large language model alignment and reasoning by emphasizing exact on-policy training and using an optimal reward baseline.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks.

AI-generated summary 				 The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:19:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23419</guid></item><item><title>D-AR: Diffusion via Autoregressive Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23660</link><description>Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR) recasts the image diffusion process as a standard autoregressive task, achieving high-quality image generation with consistent previews and layout control using a large language model backbone.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large language models.

AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce SafeScientist, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose SciSafetyBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist. red{Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 01:57:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23559</guid></item><item><title>ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22961</link><description>ToMAP enhances LLM persuaders with Theory of Mind modules, improving opponent awareness and argument quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents.

AI-generated summary 				 Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:19:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23735</guid></item><item><title>Fast-dLLM: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion LLM by Enabling KV
  Cache and Parallel Decoding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22618</link><description>A novel block-wise approximate KV Cache and confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy improve the inference speed of diffusion-based large language models without significant quality loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to 27.6times throughput improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 04:20:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22618</guid></item><item><title>GeoDrive: 3D Geometry-Informed Driving World Model with Precise Action
  Control</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22421</link><description>GeoDrive integrates robust 3D geometry into driving world models to improve spatial understanding and action controllability in autonomous navigation, enhancing safety and reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene modeling for safer autonomous driving.

AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, f-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \emph{Uni-Instruct}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the f-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded f-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded f-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \emph{1.46} for unconditional generation and \emph{1.38} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-64times 64 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \emph{1.02}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 04:07:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20755</guid></item><item><title>LoRAShop: Training-Free Multi-Concept Image Generation and Editing with

AI-generated summary 				 We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:26:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23758</guid></item><item><title>DeepTheorem: Advancing LLM Reasoning for Theorem Proving Through Natural

AI-generated summary 				 Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:48:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23754</guid></item><item><title>MAGREF: Masked Guidance for Any-Reference Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23742</link><description>MAGREF is a unified framework for video generation that uses masked guidance and dynamic masking for coherent multi-subject synthesis from diverse references and text prompts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis.

  Interactions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17818</link><description>PatientSim generates diverse and realistic patient personas using clinical data to evaluate LLMs in medical dialogue settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios, grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17818</guid></item><item><title>To Trust Or Not To Trust Your Vision-Language Model's Prediction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23745</link><description>TrustVLM enhances the reliability of Vision-Language Models by estimating prediction trustworthiness without retraining, improving misclassification detection in multimodal tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.

AI-generated summary 				 Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications. Current supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations. We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing even supervised methods.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:24:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23625</guid></item><item><title>KVzip: Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Context Reconstruction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23416</link><description>KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method for transformer-based LLMs, reduces KV cache size and decoding latency while maintaining performance across various tasks and models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value (KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand, leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV cache size by 3-4times and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately 2times, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval, reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:07:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23416</guid></item><item><title>A Graph Perspective to Probe Structural Patterns of Knowledge in Large

AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability. However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge. Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:12:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19286</guid></item><item><title>CXReasonBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Diagnostic

AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

AI-generated summary 				 We present UniTEX, a novel two-stage 3D texture generation framework to create high-quality, consistent textures for 3D assets. Existing approaches predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity, independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model (LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches, offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture generation.

AI-generated summary 				 While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:10:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22943</guid></item><item><title>One-shot Entropy Minimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20282</link><description>Entropy minimization with one sample and minimal optimization achieves significant performance improvements for large language models.

AI-generated summary 				 The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced tasks like chart understanding.

To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution.

AI-generated summary 				 Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to support further research.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 04:12:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19236</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance via Dynamic Low-Confidence Masking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20199</link><description>Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG) dynamically adjusts the guidance in masked diffusion language models by focusing on areas of low model confidence, leading to significant improvements in language generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions. However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:35:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20199</guid></item></channel></rss>
