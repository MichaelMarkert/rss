AI-generated summary 				 Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 04:14:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.04664</guid></item><item><title>WildScore: Benchmarking MLLMs in-the-Wild Symbolic Music Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.04744</link><description>WildScore evaluates MLLMs' symbolic music reasoning through a benchmark of real-world music scores and user-generated queries, revealing both strengths and challenges.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 02:29:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.04744</guid></item><item><title>Symbolic Graphics Programming with Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.05208</link><description>LLMs generate SVGs from natural-language descriptions using a reinforcement learning approach with verifiable rewards, improving performance and scene coherence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:11:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.05208</guid></item><item><title>LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for
  Interactive Complex World Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.05263</link><description>LatticeWorld, a 3D world generation framework using lightweight LLMs and Unreal Engine 5, creates dynamic, interactive environments from textual and visual inputs, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a 90times increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

AI-generated summary 				 We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window, thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/LiZizun/WinT3R.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 06:13:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.05296</guid></item><item><title>On Robustness and Reliability of Benchmark-Based Evaluation of LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.04013</link><description>LLMs show reduced effectiveness on paraphrased benchmark questions, indicating limitations in handling linguistic variability and suggesting the need for more robust evaluation methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 05:35:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.04013</guid></item><item><title>MedVista3D: Vision-Language Modeling for Reducing Diagnostic Errors in
  3D CT Disease Detection, Understanding and Reporting</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03800</link><description>MedVista3D is a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis that addresses local-global understanding, report variability, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness, and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging, where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However, existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly, lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be released.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 03:49:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03800</guid></item><item><title>LuxDiT: Lighting Estimation with Video Diffusion Transformer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03680</link><description>LuxDiT, a video diffusion transformer fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation, generates accurate HDR environment maps from visual input, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global (non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input. Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 08:10:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03680</guid></item><item><title>U-ARM : Ultra low-cost general teleoperation interface for robot
  manipulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.02437</link><description>U-Arm is a low-cost, adaptable teleoperation framework for robotic arms that optimizes mechanical design and control logic to enhance data collection efficiency and task success rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose U-Arm, a low-cost and rapidly adaptable leader-follower teleoperation framework designed to interface with most of commercially available robotic arms. Our system supports teleoperation through three structurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control logic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot configurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces, we further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving a bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and 56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common challenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods mechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Arm achieves 39\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task success rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon, another low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models of three configs and also provided simulation support for validating teleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data collected with U-Arm.

AI-generated summary 				 Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel ``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive and interactive styles. Using a curated Diagnostic Prompt Suite and an innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together, this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.
