  Dyadic Interactive Human Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09862</link><description>A large-scale dataset named SpeakerVid-5M is introduced for audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human generation, featuring diverse interactions and high-quality data for various virtual human tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours, SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking, listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of 2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work. Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly released.

AI-generated summary 				 Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 04:43:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10548</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning or Memorization? Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning
  Due to Data Contamination</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10532</link><description>Research on enhancing LLM reasoning through RL reveals that accurate reward signals are crucial for performance improvement, and current benchmarks may be unreliable due to data contamination.  					AI-generated summary 				 The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure trustworthy conclusions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 06:11:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10532</guid></item><item><title>REST: Stress Testing Large Reasoning Models by Asking Multiple Problems
  at Once</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10541</link><description>REST evaluates large reasoning models under simultaneous multi-context pressure, revealing performance differences not apparent in single-question tests and highlighting the importance of contextual priority allocation and cognitive load management.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 06:34:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10541</guid></item><item><title>LayerCake: Token-Aware Contrastive Decoding within Large Language Model
  Layers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04404</link><description>A token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method improves factual accuracy in large language models by selectively suppressing attention to specific token types at their respective depths.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 03:58:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04404</guid></item><item><title>Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive
  Token-Level Computation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10524</link><description>Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) achieves parameter and computational efficiency in large language models through shared layers and adaptive recursion depths, improving performance metrics and throughput.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 05:22:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10524</guid></item><item><title>CompassJudger-2: Towards Generalist Judge Model via Verifiable Rewards</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09104</link><description>CompassJudger-2, a generalist judge model, achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks through task-driven data curation, verifiable rewards, and a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 04:17:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09104</guid></item><item><title>MoVieS: Motion-Aware 4D Dynamic View Synthesis in One Second</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10065</link><description>MoVieS synthesizes 4D dynamic novel views from monocular videos using Gaussian primitives, enabling unified modeling of appearance, geometry, and motion with minimal task-specific supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis, reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework. By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while offering several orders of magnitude speedups.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 05:56:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10065</guid></item><item><title>From KMMLU-Redux to KMMLU-Pro: A Professional Korean Benchmark Suite for

  with SFT and Efficiency with Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08267</link><description>A combination of extended supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from online inference enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models, achieving top-tier performance on benchmarks like the AI Mathematical Olympiad.  					AI-generated summary 				 Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:45:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08267</guid></item></channel></rss>
