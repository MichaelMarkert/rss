AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

AI-generated summary 				 Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:33:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16922</guid></item><item><title>StereoPilot: Learning Unified and Efficient Stereo Conversion via Generative Priors</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16915</link><description>StereoPilot, a feed-forward model leveraging a learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss, synthesizes high-quality stereo video directly without depth maps, outperforming existing methods in visual fidelity and computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

AI-generated summary 				 We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 02:49:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16776</guid></item><item><title>Adaptation of Agentic AI</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16301</link><description>This paper presents a framework for agent and tool adaptation in agentic AI systems, clarifying design strategies and identifying open challenges for improving AI capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 02:53:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16301</guid></item><item><title>LLaDA2.0: Scaling Up Diffusion Language Models to 100B</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.15745</link><description>LLaDA2.0 converts auto-regressive models into discrete diffusion large language models using a block-level training scheme, improving efficiency and performance at large scales.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 02:52:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.15745</guid></item><item><title>Generative Refocusing: Flexible Defocus Control from a Single Image</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16923</link><description>Generative Refocusing uses semi-supervised learning with DeblurNet and BokehNet to achieve high-quality single-image refocusing with controllable bokeh and text-guided adjustments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 04:45:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16923</guid></item><item><title>DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16625</link><description>DeContext defends against unauthorized in-context image editing by weakening cross-attention pathways in multimodal attention layers, preserving visual quality while blocking unwanted modifications.  					AI-generated summary 				 In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16625</guid></item><item><title>Alchemist: Unlocking Efficiency in Text-to-Image Model Training via Meta-Gradient Data Selection</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16905</link><description>Alchemist, a meta-gradient-based framework, automatically selects high-quality subsets from large-scale text-image datasets to improve visual quality and training efficiency in Text-to-Image models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:46:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16905</guid></item><item><title>Exploration v.s. Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16912</link><description>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards improves LLM reasoning through spurious rewards and entropy minimization, despite seemingly paradoxical effects, by reducing clipping bias and policy entropy.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:16:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16912</guid></item><item><title>RePlan: Reasoning-guided Region Planning for Complex Instruction-based Image Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16864</link><description>RePlan, a plan-then-execute framework, enhances instruction-based image editing by combining a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor, achieving superior performance in complex and intricate editing tasks using limited data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

AI-generated summary 				 Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:28:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16921</guid></item><item><title>N3D-VLM: Native 3D Grounding Enables Accurate Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16561</link><description>N3D-VLM integrates native 3D perception and reasoning in vision-language models, enabling precise 3D localization and spatial understanding with a large-scale dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16561</guid></item><item><title>AdaTooler-V: Adaptive Tool-Use for Images and Videos</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16918</link><description>AdaTooler-V, a multimodal large language model, adaptively uses vision tools based on reinforcement learning, improving performance and reducing unnecessary tool invocations in visual reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 04:22:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.16918</guid></item><item><title>TabReX : Tabular Referenceless eXplainable Evaluation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.15907</link><description>TabReX is a reference-less framework using graph-based reasoning to evaluate the quality of tables generated by LLMs, offering structural and factual fidelity scores.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 02:55:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.15907</guid></item><item><title>EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.15528</link><description>EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model, enhances Visual Emotion Comprehension by verbalizing confidence in emotion predictions, leading to improved reliability and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems.

AI-generated summary 				 While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \b{Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:05:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.12576</guid></item></channel></rss>
