AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective, showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:16:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03724</guid></item><item><title>4DSloMo: 4D Reconstruction for High Speed Scene with Asynchronous
  Capture</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05163</link><description>A high-speed 4D capturing system using low FPS cameras with asynchronous capture and video-diffusion-based artifact correction enhances reconstruction quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency, and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to synchronous capture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:44:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05163</guid></item><item><title>Pre-Trained Policy Discriminators are General Reward Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05197</link><description>A scalable reward modeling method, Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), enhances reward model performance and generalizes robustly in reinforcement learning through policy comparison.  					AI-generated summary 				 We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from 1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance. For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36% to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover, scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99. The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong reward models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:48:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05197</guid></item><item><title>BMMR: A Large-Scale Bilingual Multimodal Multi-Discipline Reasoning
  Dataset</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03483</link><description>A large-scale dataset and verification tool are introduced for assessing and improving cross-disciplinary reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal, multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:30:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03483</guid></item><item><title>RefineX: Learning to Refine Pre-training Data at Scale from
  Expert-Guided Programs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03253</link><description>RefineX is a scalable framework for improving the quality of large language model pre-training data through programmatic editing, yielding better performance than alternative methods across various downstream tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose RefineX, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:23:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03253</guid></item><item><title>ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code
  Generation Evaluation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04952</link><description>ArtifactsBench, a novel benchmark and evaluation framework, automates the assessment of visual code generation quality using temporal screenshots and a multimodal language model judge.  					AI-generated summary 				 The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:23:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04952</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Simple Edits: X-Planner for Complex Instruction-Based Image
  Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05259</link><description>X-Planner, a planning system utilizing a multimodal large language model, decomposes complex text-guided image editing instructions into precise sub-instructions, ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits and achieving top performance on established benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly introduced complex editing benchmark.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 05:16:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05259</guid></item><item><title>VLM2Vec-V2: Advancing Multimodal Embedding for Videos, Images, and
  Visual Documents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04590</link><description>A unified framework VLM2Vec-V2 is proposed for learning embeddings across diverse visual forms such as videos and documents, demonstrating strong performance on new tasks and improving upon existing benchmarks for images.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec, E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2 achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and real-world settings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:56:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04590</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating LLMs on Real-World Forecasting Against Human Superforecasters</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04562</link><description>State-of-the-art large language models are evaluated on forecasting questions and show lower accuracy compared to human superforecasters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of superforecasters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 05:21:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04562</guid></item><item><title>Disambiguation-Centric Finetuning Makes Enterprise Tool-Calling LLMs
  More Realistic and Less Risky</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03336</link><description>DiaFORGE is a disambiguation framework that enhances large language models' ability to invoke enterprise APIs accurately through dialogue synthesis, supervised fine-tuning, and real-world evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation &amp; Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.03336</guid></item><item><title>PresentAgent: Multimodal Agent for Presentation Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04036</link><description>A multimodal agent transforms documents into detailed presentation videos with audio, evaluated using a comprehensive framework involving vision-language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PresentAgent.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:44:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04036</guid></item><item><title>OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device
  Speculative Decoding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.02659</link><description>OmniDraft, a unified framework, addresses cross-vocabulary mismatch and improves decoding speed by allowing a single draft model to interact dynamically with diverse target models in online settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the ``one drafter for all'' paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:04:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.02659</guid></item></channel></rss>
