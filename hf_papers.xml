AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 02:27:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.01106</guid></item><item><title>Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.00375</link><description>InfoSeek is a scalable framework for generating complex Deep Research tasks by synthesizing hierarchical constraint satisfaction problems, enabling models to outperform larger baselines on challenging benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek{this repository}.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 03:12:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.00375</guid></item><item><title>Mixture of Global and Local Experts with Diffusion Transformer for
  Controllable Face Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.00428</link><description>Face-MoGLE, a novel framework using Diffusion Transformers, achieves high-quality, controllable face generation through semantic-decoupled latent modeling, expert specialization, and dynamic gating.  					AI-generated summary 				 Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1) Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its robust zero-shot generalization capability.

  Pretraining Data to Representations</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03405</link><description>LMEnt is a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in language models during pretraining, providing annotated corpora, retrieval methods, and pretrained models to study knowledge representations and learning dynamics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete. To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks. Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 08:33:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.03405</guid></item><item><title>MOSAIC: Multi-Subject Personalized Generation via Correspondence-Aware
  Alignment and Disentanglement</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.01977</link><description>MOSAIC framework enhances multi-subject image generation by ensuring precise semantic alignment and orthogonal feature disentanglement, achieving high fidelity even with multiple references.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference. To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 06:35:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.01977</guid></item></channel></rss>
