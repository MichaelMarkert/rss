Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural
  Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07920</link><description>Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:05:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07920</guid></item><item><title>LMM-R1: Empowering 3B LMMs with Strong Reasoning Abilities Through
  Two-Stage Rule-Based RL</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07536</link><description>Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning, particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.   While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.   To address these challenges, we propose \method, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE) followed by Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT). The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.   Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \method achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07536</guid></item><item><title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08638</link><description>We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging lyrics-to-song problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

  with Unified Multimodal Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08120</link><description>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on coarse facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle fine-grained facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniF^2ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train UniF^2ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, UniF^2ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on UniF^2ace-130K demonstrate that UniF^2ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:20:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08120</guid></item><item><title>MagicInfinite: Generating Infinite Talking Videos with Your Words and
  Voice</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.05978</link><description>We present MagicInfinite, a novel diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework that overcomes traditional portrait animation limitations, delivering high-fidelity results across diverse character types-realistic humans, full-body figures, and stylized anime characters. It supports varied facial poses, including back-facing views, and animates single or multiple characters with input masks for precise speaker designation in multi-character scenes. Our approach tackles key challenges with three innovations: (1) 3D full-attention mechanisms with a sliding window denoising strategy, enabling infinite video generation with temporal coherence and visual quality across diverse character styles; (2) a two-stage curriculum learning scheme, integrating audio for lip sync, text for expressive dynamics, and reference images for &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;identity preservation&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;, enabling flexible multi-modal control over long sequences; and (3) region-specific masks with adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance, supporting speaker-specific animations. Efficiency is enhanced via our innovative unified step and cfg distillation techniques, achieving a 20x inference speed boost over the basemodel: generating a 10 second 540x540p video in 10 seconds or 720x720p in 30 seconds on 8 H100 GPUs, without quality loss. Evaluations on our new benchmark demonstrate MagicInfinite's superiority in audio-lip synchronization, identity preservation, and motion naturalness across diverse scenarios.

  Imitating Human Annotator Trajectories</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08625</link><description>While MLLMs have demonstrated adequate image understanding capabilities, they still struggle with pixel-level comprehension, limiting their practical applications. Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding.   Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering.   HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08625</guid></item><item><title>Seedream 2.0: A Native Chinese-English Bilingual Image Generation
  Foundation Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07703</link><description>Rapid advancement of diffusion models has catalyzed remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5 and Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text rendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural nuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across diverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and English, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a powerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption system that balances the accuracy and richness for image description. Particularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large language model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge directly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images with accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either Chinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible character-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to untrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT and RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics, text rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been optimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with human preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it can be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as SeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following and image consistency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:45:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07703</guid></item><item><title>Gemini Embedding: Generalizable Embeddings from Gemini</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07891</link><description>In this report, we introduce Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 04:08:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07891</guid></item><item><title>Implicit Reasoning in Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07604</link><description>Test-time compute is emerging as a new paradigm for enhancing language models' complex multi-step reasoning capabilities, as demonstrated by the success of OpenAI's o1 and o3, as well as DeepSeek's R1. Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on un&lt;PRE_TAG&gt;fixed-pattern data&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize further. Notably, this limitation is also observed in state-of-the-art large language models. These findings suggest that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning, enabling strong performance on tasks with similar patterns while lacking generalization.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:31:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07604</guid></item><item><title>LightGen: Efficient Image Generation through Knowledge Distillation and
  Direct Preference Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08619</link><description>Recent advances in text-to-image generation have primarily relied on extensive datasets and parameter-heavy architectures. These requirements severely limit accessibility for researchers and practitioners who lack substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce \model, an efficient training paradigm for image generation models that uses knowledge distillation (KD) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Drawing inspiration from the success of data KD techniques widely adopted in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), LightGen distills knowledge from state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image models into a compact Masked Autoregressive (MAR) architecture with only 0.7B parameters. Using a compact &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;synthetic dataset&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; of just 2M high-quality images generated from varied captions, we demonstrate that data diversity significantly outweighs data volume in determining model performance. This strategy dramatically reduces computational demands and reduces pre-training time from potentially thousands of GPU-days to merely 88 GPU-days. Furthermore, to address the inherent shortcomings of synthetic data, particularly poor high-frequency details and spatial inaccuracies, we integrate the DPO technique that refines image fidelity and positional accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that LightGen achieves image generation quality comparable to SOTA models while significantly reducing computational resources and expanding accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

  Sampling</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08605</link><description>While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:13:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08605</guid></item><item><title>Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07572</link><description>Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:32:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07572</guid></item><item><title>OmniMamba: Efficient and Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation
  via State Space Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08686</link><description>Recent advancements in unified multimodal understanding and visual generation (or multimodal generation) models have been hindered by their quadratic computational complexity and dependence on large-scale training data. We present OmniMamba, the first linear-architecture-based multimodal generation model that generates both text and images through a unified next-token prediction paradigm. The model fully leverages Mamba-2's high computational and memory efficiency, extending its capabilities from text generation to multimodal generation. To address the data inefficiency of existing unified models, we propose two key innovations: (1) decoupled vocabularies to guide modality-specific generation, and (2) task-specific LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled two-stage training strategy to mitigate data imbalance between two tasks. Equipped with these techniques, OmniMamba achieves competitive performance with JanusFlow while surpassing Show-o across benchmarks, despite being trained on merely 2M image-text pairs, which is 1,000 times fewer than Show-o. Notably, OmniMamba stands out with outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 119.2 times speedup and 63% GPU memory reduction for long-sequence generation compared to Transformer-based counterparts.

In this work, we introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many applications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on this new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences and 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. By analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key challenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and fine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff method, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage utilizing specialized foundation models. To encourage future research in this new task, we release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/VidDiffBench and code at http://jmhb0.github.io/viddiff.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:55:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07860</guid></item><item><title>CineBrain: A Large-Scale Multi-Modal Brain Dataset During Naturalistic
  Audiovisual Narrative Processing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06940</link><description>In this paper, we introduce CineBrain, the first large-scale dataset featuring simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings during dynamic audiovisual stimulation. Recognizing the complementary strengths of EEG's high temporal resolution and fMRI's deep-brain spatial coverage, CineBrain provides approximately six hours of narrative-driven content from the popular television series The Big Bang Theory for each of six participants. Building upon this unique dataset, we propose CineSync, an innovative multimodal decoding framework integrates a Multi-Modal Fusion Encoder with a diffusion-based Neural Latent Decoder. Our approach effectively fuses EEG and fMRI signals, significantly improving the reconstruction quality of complex audiovisual stimuli. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce Cine-Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation protocol that assesses reconstructions across semantic and perceptual dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that CineSync achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction performance and highlight our initial success in combining fMRI and EEG for reconstructing both video and audio stimuli.

While existing visual tokenizers primarily optimize for reconstruction fidelity, they often neglect the structural properties of the latent space -- a critical factor for both interpretability and downstream tasks. Our method generates a 1D causal token sequence for images, where each successive token contributes non-overlapping information with mathematically guaranteed decreasing explained variance, analogous to principal component analysis. This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information. Additionally, we identified and resolved a semantic-spectrum coupling effect that causes the unwanted entanglement of high-level semantic content and low-level spectral details in the tokens by leveraging a diffusion decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and enables better interpretability to align with the human vision system. Moreover, auto-regressive models trained on our token sequences achieve performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer tokens for training and inference.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:53:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08685</guid></item><item><title>Perplexity Trap: PLM-Based Retrievers Overrate Low Perplexity Documents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08684</link><description>Previous studies have found that PLM-based retrieval models exhibit a preference for LLM-generated content, assigning higher relevance scores to these documents even when their semantic quality is comparable to human-written ones. This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem. However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored. In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher. Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task. Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC). CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score. Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.

Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:24:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08588</guid></item><item><title>QuoTA: Query-oriented Token Assignment via CoT Query Decouple for Long
  Video Comprehension</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08689</link><description>Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual redundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution. However, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in decoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between visual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an ante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language models (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level importance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it aligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token budget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content. Specifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores based on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before cross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame importance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that extends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that implementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance improvement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while operating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

  Trajectories</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07699</link><description>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, their slow generation speed remains a critical challenge. Existing acceleration methods, while aiming to reduce steps, often compromise sample quality, controllability, or introduce training complexities. Therefore, we propose RayFlow, a novel diffusion framework that addresses these limitations. Unlike previous methods, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution. This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps. Extensive experiments demonstrate RayFlow's superiority in generating high-quality images with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 04:59:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07699</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking AI Models in Software Engineering: A Review, Search Tool,
  and Enhancement Protocol</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.05860</link><description>Benchmarks are essential for consistent evaluation and reproducibility. The integration of Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (AI4SE) has given rise to numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, this surge presents challenges: (1) scattered benchmark knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting relevant benchmarks, (3) the absence of a uniform standard for benchmark development, and (4) limitations of existing benchmarks. In this paper, we review 173 studies and identify 204 AI4SE benchmarks. We classify these benchmarks, analyze their limitations, and expose gaps in practices. Based on our review, we created BenchScout, a semantic search tool to find relevant benchmarks, using automated clustering of the contexts from associated studies. We conducted a user study with 22 participants to evaluate BenchScout's usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness which resulted in average scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5. To advance benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified method to enhance benchmark quality. As a case study, we applied BenchFrame to the HumanEval benchmark and addressed its main limitations. This led to &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;HumanEvalNext&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;, featuring (1) corrected errors, (2) improved language conversion, (3) expanded test coverage, and (4) increased difficulty. We then evaluated ten state-of-the-art code language models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;HumanEvalNext&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. On &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;HumanEvalNext&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;, models showed a pass@1 score reduction of 31.22% and 19.94% compared to HumanEval and HumanEvalPlus, respectively.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:28:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.05860</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Intelligence via Trial and Error</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.18858</link><description>Intelligence is a crucial trait for species to find solutions within a limited number of trial-and-error attempts. Building on this idea, we introduce Survival Game as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of failed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher intelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both finite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new challenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using Survival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results show that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they are still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search, recommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help, this would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the Autonomous Level for general tasks would require 10^{26} parameters. To put this into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs that their total value is 10^{7} times that of Apple Inc.'s market value. Even with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take 70 years. This staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the inadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its experimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a criticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep understanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however, do not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry, making it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level. We believe Survival Game can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound insights into human intelligence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 04:16:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.18858</guid></item><item><title>Referring to Any Person</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08507</link><description>Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08417</link><description>Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:49:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08417</guid></item><item><title>AI-native Memory 2.0: Second Me</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08102</link><description>Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:40:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08102</guid></item><item><title>Mixture of Experts Made Intrinsically Interpretable</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07639</link><description>Neurons in large language models often exhibit polysemanticity, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present MoE-X, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be intrinsically interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;sparse activations&lt;/POST_TAG&gt; are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:32:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07639</guid></item><item><title>NullFace: Training-Free Localized Face Anonymization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.08478</link><description>Privacy concerns around ever increasing number of cameras are increasing in today's digital age. Although existing anonymization methods are able to obscure identity information, they often struggle to preserve the utility of the images. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face anonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring optimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its initial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned diffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized face is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports localized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are anonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art methods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and image quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it well-suited for real-world applications.

  Machine Translation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06594</link><description>The field of neural machine translation (NMT) has changed with the advent of large language models (&lt;PRE_TAG&gt;LLMs)&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;Transformer decoder&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation quality, but achieve 2.4 sim 6.5 times inference speedups and a 75% reduction in the memory footprint of the KV cache. It also demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of translation-related tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:47:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06594</guid></item><item><title>VisualSimpleQA: A Benchmark for Decoupled Evaluation of Large
  Vision-Language Models in Fact-Seeking Question Answering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06492</link><description>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable achievements, yet the generation of non-factual responses remains prevalent in fact-seeking question answering (QA). Current multimodal fact-seeking benchmarks primarily focus on comparing model outputs to ground truth answers, providing limited insights into the performance of modality-specific modules. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualSimpleQA, a multimodal fact-seeking benchmark with two key features. First, it enables streamlined and decoupled evaluation of LVLMs in visual and linguistic modalities. Second, it incorporates well-defined difficulty criteria to guide human annotation and facilitates the extraction of a challenging subset, &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;VisualSimpleQA-hard&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. Experiments on 15 LVLMs show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve merely 60%+ correctness in multimodal fact-seeking QA on VisualSimpleQA and 30%+ on &lt;PRE_TAG&gt;VisualSimpleQA-hard&lt;/POST_TAG&gt;. Furthermore, the decoupled evaluation across these models highlights substantial opportunities for improvement in both visual and linguistic modules. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/WYLing/VisualSimpleQA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:19:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06492</guid></item></channel></rss>
