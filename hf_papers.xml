AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Step 3.5 Flash, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that bridges frontier-level agentic intelligence and computational efficiency. We focus on what matters most when building agents: sharp reasoning and fast, reliable execution. Step 3.5 Flash pairs a 196B-parameter foundation with 11B active parameters for efficient inference. It is optimized with interleaved 3:1 sliding-window/full attention and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP-3) to reduce the latency and cost of multi-round agentic interactions. To reach frontier-level intelligence, we design a scalable reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable signals with preference feedback, while remaining stable under large-scale off-policy training, enabling consistent self-improvement across mathematics, code, and tool use. Step 3.5 Flash demonstrates strong performance across agent, coding, and math tasks, achieving 85.4% on IMO-AnswerBench, 86.4% on LiveCodeBench-v6 (2024.08-2025.05), 88.2% on tau2-Bench, 69.0% on BrowseComp (with context management), and 51.0% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, comparable to frontier models such as GPT-5.2 xHigh and Gemini 3.0 Pro. By redefining the efficiency frontier, Step 3.5 Flash provides a high-density foundation for deploying sophisticated agents in real-world industrial environments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:20:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10604</guid></item><item><title>GENIUS: Generative Fluid Intelligence Evaluation Suite</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11144</link><description>GENIUS evaluates multimodal models' generative fluid intelligence through pattern induction, constraint execution, and contextual adaptation tasks, revealing deficiencies in context comprehension rather than generative capability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess Crystallized Intelligence, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI): the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce GENIUS (GEN Fluid Intelligence EvalUation Suite). We formalize GFI as a synthesis of three primitives. These include Inducing Implicit Patterns (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), Executing Ad-hoc Constraints (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and Adapting to Contextual Knowledge (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, GENIUS establishes a rigorous standard for GFI, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:36:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11144</guid></item><item><title>PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11124</link><description>PhyCritic is a multimodal critic model designed for physical AI tasks through a two-stage RLVR pipeline that enhances perception and reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:37:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11124</guid></item><item><title>When to Memorize and When to Stop: Gated Recurrent Memory for Long-Context Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10560</link><description>GRU-Mem addresses long-context reasoning challenges in LLMs by incorporating text-controlled gates and reinforcement learning rewards to stabilize memory updates and improve computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 While reasoning over long context is crucial for various real-world applications, it remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they suffer from performance degradation as the context length grows. Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals r^{update} and r^{exit} within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\% times inference speed acceleration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:27:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10560</guid></item><item><title>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10177</link><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:56:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10177</guid></item><item><title>TimeChat-Captioner: Scripting Multi-Scene Videos with Time-Aware and Structural Audio-Visual Captions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08711</link><description>Omni Dense Captioning introduces a six-dimensional structural schema for generating time-aware audio-visual narratives with explicit timestamps, along with a unified evaluation metric and strong baseline model.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper proposes Omni Dense Captioning, a novel task designed to generate continuous, fine-grained, and structured audio-visual narratives with explicit timestamps. To ensure dense semantic coverage, we introduce a six-dimensional structural schema to create "script-like" captions, enabling readers to vividly imagine the video content scene by scene, akin to a cinematographic screenplay. To facilitate research, we construct OmniDCBench, a high-quality, human-annotated benchmark, and propose SodaM, a unified metric that evaluates time-aware detailed descriptions while mitigating scene boundary ambiguity. Furthermore, we construct a training dataset, TimeChatCap-42K, and present TimeChat-Captioner-7B, a strong baseline trained via SFT and GRPO with task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeChat-Captioner-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro, while its generated dense descriptions significantly boost downstream capabilities in audio-visual reasoning (DailyOmni and WorldSense) and temporal grounding (Charades-STA). All datasets, models, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yaolinli/TimeChat-Captioner.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:10:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08711</guid></item><item><title>G-LNS: Generative Large Neighborhood Search for LLM-Based Automatic Heuristic Design</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08253</link><description>A generative evolutionary framework extends large language models for automated design of large neighborhood search operators in combinatorial optimization problems.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in Automated Heuristic Design (AHD), existing approaches typically formulate AHD around constructive priority rules or parameterized local search guidance, thereby restricting the search space to fixed heuristic forms. Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:40:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08253</guid></item><item><title>ASA: Training-Free Representation Engineering for Tool-Calling Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04935</link><description>A training-free method called Activation Steering Adapter corrects tool calling behavior in language models by using mid-layer activation interventions guided by a probe and router-conditioned steering vectors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Adapting LLM agents to domain-specific tool calling remains notably brittle under evolving interfaces. Prompt and schema engineering is easy to deploy but often fragile under distribution shift and strict parsers, while continual parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves reliability at the cost of training, maintenance, and potential forgetting. We identify a critical Lazy Agent failure mode where tool necessity is nearly perfectly decodable from mid-layer activations, yet the model remains conservative in entering tool mode, revealing a representation-behavior gap. We propose Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a training-free, inference-time controller that performs a single-shot mid-layer intervention and targets tool domains via a router-conditioned mixture of steering vectors with a probe-guided signed gate to amplify true intent while suppressing spurious triggers. On MTU-Bench with Qwen2.5-1.5B, ASA improves strict tool-use F1 from 0.18 to 0.50 while reducing the false positive rate from 0.15 to 0.05, using only about 20KB of portable assets and no weight updates.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:02:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04935</guid></item><item><title>DataChef: Cooking Up Optimal Data Recipes for LLM Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11089</link><description>DataChef-32B automates data recipe generation for LLM adaptation through reinforcement learning with proxy rewards, achieving performance comparable to human-crafted recipes.  					AI-generated summary 				 In the current landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the curation of large-scale, high-quality training data is a primary driver of model performance. A key lever is the data recipe, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate end-to-end data recipe generation for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B. This work sheds new light on automating LLM training and developing self-evolving AI systems.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:39:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11089</guid></item><item><title>FeatureBench: Benchmarking Agentic Coding for Complex Feature Development</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10975</link><description>FeatureBench evaluates agentic coding performance in comprehensive feature-oriented development through execution-based assessments and automated task derivation from code repositories.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:23:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10975</guid></item><item><title>ROCKET: Rapid Optimization via Calibration-guided Knapsack Enhanced Truncation for Efficient Model Compression</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11008</link><description>ROCKET is a training-free model compression method that formulates layer-wise compression as a multi-choice knapsack problem and uses sparse matrix factorization for efficient weight sparsification without iterative optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 06:22:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11008</guid></item><item><title>Internalizing Meta-Experience into Memory for Guided Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10224</link><description>Meta-Experience Learning enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating self-distilled error representations into parametric memory through contrastive trajectory analysis and language-modeled reward signals.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:57:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10224</guid></item><item><title>Ex-Omni: Enabling 3D Facial Animation Generation for Omni-modal Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07106</link><description>Ex-Omni is an open-source framework that enhances omni-modal large language models with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation and using speech units as temporal scaffolding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:49:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07106</guid></item><item><title>CLI-Gym: Scalable CLI Task Generation via Agentic Environment Inversion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10999</link><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:56:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10999</guid></item><item><title>Online Causal Kalman Filtering for Stable and Effective Policy Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10609</link><description>Online Causal Kalman Filtering addresses high-variance token-level importance sampling in reinforcement learning for large language models by modeling IS ratios as evolving latent states and using Kalman filtering for stable policy optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:18:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10609</guid></item><item><title>Stroke3D: Lifting 2D strokes into rigged 3D model via latent diffusion models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09713</link><description>Stroke3D generates rigged 3D meshes from 2D strokes and text prompts through a two-stage pipeline combining controllable skeleton generation with enhanced mesh synthesis.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:00:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09713</guid></item><item><title>EcoGym: Evaluating LLMs for Long-Horizon Plan-and-Execute in Interactive Economies</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09514</link><description>EcoGym presents a generalizable benchmark for evaluating long-horizon planning capabilities of LLM-based agents in interactive economic environments with persistent dynamics and multi-scenario evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:55:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09514</guid></item><item><title>QP-OneModel: A Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in Xiaohongshu Search</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09901</link><description>A unified generative large language model approach for social network search query processing that improves semantic understanding through multi-task learning and reinforcement learning while enhancing downstream task performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Query Processing (QP) bridges user intent and content supply in large-scale Social Network Service (SNS) search engines. Traditional QP systems rely on pipelines of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT), suffering from limited semantic understanding and high maintenance overhead. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches often optimize sub-tasks in isolation, neglecting intrinsic semantic synergy and necessitating independent iterations. Moreover, standard generative methods often lack grounding in SNS scenarios, failing to bridge the gap between open-domain corpora and informal SNS linguistic patterns, while struggling to adhere to rigorous business definitions. We present QP-OneModel, a Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in the SNS domain. We reformulate heterogeneous sub-tasks into a unified sequence generation paradigm, adopting a progressive three-stage alignment strategy culminating in multi-reward Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, QP-OneModel generates intent descriptions as a novel high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream tasks such as query rewriting and ranking. Offline evaluations show QP-OneModel achieves a 7.35% overall gain over discriminative baselines, with significant F1 boosts in NER (+9.01%) and Term Weighting (+9.31%). It also exhibits superior generalization, surpassing a 32B model by 7.60% accuracy on unseen tasks. Fully deployed at Xiaohongshu, online A/B tests confirm its industrial value, optimizing retrieval relevance (DCG) by 0.21% and lifting user retention by 0.044%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:22:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09901</guid></item><item><title>When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10179</link><description>Visual-to-visual jailbreak attacks compromise image editing models through malicious visual inputs, necessitating new safety benchmarks and defense mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems.

AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store structured factual knowledge by linking entities through relationships, crucial for many applications. These applications depend on the KG's factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on a large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored.   In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing a multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes a RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. Additionally, we offer an interactive exploration platform for analyzing verification decisions.   The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches -- at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of a one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for a benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progress on this difficult yet crucial task.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:28:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10748</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Correctness: Learning Robust Reasoning via Transfer</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08489</link><description>Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR) enhances LLM reasoning robustness by ensuring reasoning stability and generalizability through transfer rewards that test cross-model guidance capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:58:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08489</guid></item><item><title>Free(): Learning to Forget in Malloc-Only Reasoning Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08030</link><description>Free()LM addresses reasoning model limitations by introducing a self-forgetting mechanism through a Free-Module plug-and-play LoRA adapter, improving performance across scales and long-horizon tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as "malloc-only" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.   Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:51:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08030</guid></item><item><title>Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11149</link><description>Training reasoning language models with repeated examples on smaller datasets yields better performance than single-pass training on larger datasets, with token accuracy serving as a reliable indicator for optimal training duration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:00:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11149</guid></item><item><title>Bielik Guard: Efficient Polish Language Safety Classifiers for LLM Content Moderation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07954</link><description>Bielik Guard is a compact Polish language safety classifier family with two variants that effectively categorize content across five safety domains while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in Polish language applications, the need for efficient and accurate content safety classifiers has become paramount. We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:56:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.07954</guid></item><item><title>AgenticPay: A Multi-Agent LLM Negotiation System for Buyer-Seller Transactions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.06008</link><description>AgenticPay presents a benchmark and simulation framework for evaluating multi-agent language-mediated economic interactions, focusing on negotiation performance and strategic reasoning challenges in complex market scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

AI-generated summary 				 Self-evolving memory serves as the trainable parameters for Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents, where extraction (distilling insights from experience) and management (updating the memory bank) must be tightly coordinated. Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:46:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10652</guid></item><item><title>ArcFlow: Unleashing 2-Step Text-to-Image Generation via High-Precision Non-Linear Flow Distillation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09014</link><description>ArcFlow is a few-step distillation framework that uses non-linear flow trajectories to approximate teacher diffusion models, achieving fast inference with minimal quality loss through lightweight adapter training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generation quality, but they suffer from significant inference cost due to their reliance on multiple sequential denoising steps, motivating recent efforts to distill this inference process into a few-step regime. However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:53:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.09014</guid></item><item><title>FedPS: Federated data Preprocessing via aggregated Statistics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10870</link><description>FedPS is a federated data preprocessing framework that uses aggregated statistics and data-sketching techniques to enable efficient and privacy-preserving data preparation for collaborative machine learning across distributed datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:49:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10870</guid></item><item><title>Spend Search Where It Pays: Value-Guided Structured Sampling and Optimization for Generative Recommendation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10699</link><description>V-STAR addresses limitations in generative recommendation by combining value-guided decoding and tree-structured advantage reinforcement to improve exploration and reward signal quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:50:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10699</guid></item><item><title>When Actions Go Off-Task: Detecting and Correcting Misaligned Actions in Computer-Use Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08995</link><description>Computer-use agents face safety risks from misaligned actions caused by external attacks or internal limitations, prompting the development of DeAction, a guardrail that detects and corrects such actions before execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-use agents (CUAs) have made tremendous progress in the past year, yet they still frequently produce misaligned actions that deviate from the user's original intent. Such misaligned actions may arise from external attacks (e.g., indirect prompt injection) or from internal limitations (e.g., erroneous reasoning). They not only expose CUAs to safety risks, but also degrade task efficiency and reliability. This work makes the first effort to define and study misaligned action detection in CUAs, with comprehensive coverage of both externally induced and internally arising misaligned actions. We further identify three common categories in real-world CUA deployment and construct MisActBench, a benchmark of realistic trajectories with human-annotated, action-level alignment labels. Moreover, we propose DeAction, a practical and universal guardrail that detects misaligned actions before execution and iteratively corrects them through structured feedback. DeAction outperforms all existing baselines across offline and online evaluations with moderate latency overhead: (1) On MisActBench, it outperforms baselines by over 15% absolute in F1 score; (2) In online evaluation, it reduces attack success rate by over 90% under adversarial settings while preserving or even improving task success rate in benign environments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:55:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08995</guid></item><item><title>Weight Decay Improves Language Model Plasticity</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11137</link><description>Pretraining with larger weight decay values improves model plasticity and downstream fine-tuning performance by encouraging linearly separable representations and reducing overfitting.  					AI-generated summary 				 The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:16:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11137</guid></item><item><title>Blockwise Advantage Estimation for Multi-Objective RL with Verifiable Rewards</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10231</link><description>Blockwise Advantage Estimation addresses reward interference in structured generations by assigning separate advantages to different text blocks, using outcome-conditioned baselines to avoid expensive nested rollouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:46:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10231</guid></item></channel></rss>
