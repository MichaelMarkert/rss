  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22617</link><description>Entropy dynamics in reinforcement learning with large language models are investigated to prevent policy entropy collapse and improve exploration.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 03:08:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22617</guid></item><item><title>R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large
  Model Token Routing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21600</link><description>Roads to Rome (R2R) selectively utilizes large language models for critical reasoning tasks to enhance efficiency and performance in lightweight models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

  Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20411</link><description>A novel pipeline extracts real-world, interactive software engineering tasks from GitHub to create SWE-rebench, improving the evaluation of reinforcement learning models in SWE.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 08:29:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20411</guid></item><item><title>Sherlock: Self-Correcting Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22651</link><description>Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement framework for reasoning vision-language models, enhances accuracy across benchmarks using limited annotated data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic beta for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22651</guid></item><item><title>Skywork Open Reasoner 1 Technical Report</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22312</link><description>Skywork-OR1 is a reinforcement learning approach for long Chain-of-Thought models that improves accuracy over DeepSeek-R1 across various benchmarks by addressing entropy collapse.  					AI-generated summary 				 The success of DeepSeek-R1 underscores the significant role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22312</guid></item><item><title>Unsupervised Post-Training for Multi-Modal LLM Reasoning via GRPO</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22453</link><description>MM-UPT, a framework employing GRPO and self-rewarding, enhances multi-modal LLMs through unsupervised continual learning, showing performance improvements without manual annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %rightarrow72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9 %rightarrow68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual, autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision.

AI-generated summary 				 The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:42:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21136</guid></item><item><title>Fostering Video Reasoning via Next-Event Prediction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22457</link><description>Next-event prediction (NEP) is proposed as a learning task to enable MLLMs to reason temporally over video inputs, using future video segments as a self-supervised signal.  					AI-generated summary 				 Next-token prediction serves as the foundational learning task enabling reasoning in LLMs. But what should the learning task be when aiming to equip MLLMs with temporal reasoning capabilities over video inputs? Existing tasks such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction (NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich, self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:14:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22457</guid></item><item><title>Advancing Multimodal Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Cold
  Start</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22334</link><description>A two-stage approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning enhances multimodal reasoning in large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %rightarrow73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %rightarrow70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models.

  Global Illumination</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21925</link><description>RenderFormer is a transformer-based neural rendering pipeline that renders images from triangle representations without per-scene training and with full global illumination effects.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with varying complexity in shape and light transport.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21925</guid></item><item><title>DeepResearchGym: A Free, Transparent, and Reproducible Evaluation
  Sandbox for Deep Research</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19253</link><description>DeepResearchGym provides an open-source evaluation framework for deep research systems using a reproducible search API and LLM-as-a-judge assessments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research systems represent an emerging class of agentic information retrieval methods that generate comprehensive and well-supported reports to complex queries. However, most existing frameworks rely on dynamic commercial search APIs, which pose reproducibility and transparency challenges in addition to their cost. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepResearchGym, an open-source sandbox that combines a reproducible search API with a rigorous evaluation protocol for benchmarking deep research systems. The API indexes large-scale public web corpora, namely ClueWeb22 and FineWeb, using a state-of-the-art dense retriever and approximate nearest neighbor search via DiskANN. It achieves lower latency than popular commercial APIs while ensuring stable document rankings across runs, and is freely available for research use. To evaluate deep research systems' outputs, we extend the Researchy Questions benchmark with automatic metrics through LLM-as-a-judge assessments to measure alignment with users' information needs, retrieval faithfulness, and report quality. Experimental results show that systems integrated with DeepResearchGym achieve performance comparable to those using commercial APIs, with performance rankings remaining consistent across evaluation metrics. A human evaluation study further confirms that our automatic protocol aligns with human preferences, validating the framework's ability to help support controlled assessment of deep research systems. Our code and API documentation are available at https://www.deepresearchgym.ai.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 01:58:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19253</guid></item><item><title>Chain-of-Zoom: Extreme Super-Resolution via Scale Autoregression and
  Preference Alignment</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18600</link><description>Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ) enhances single-image super-resolution models by using an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states and multi-scale-aware prompts to achieve extreme magnifications with high quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

  Data Filtering with Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22232</link><description>JQL systematically curates high-quality multilingual training data using pretrained multilingual embeddings, outperforming heuristic methods and improving downstream model training across diverse languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 09:08:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22232</guid></item><item><title>SVRPBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21887</link><description>SVRPBench introduces a new benchmark for vehicle routing under uncertainty, simulating realistic urban conditions and highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art RL solvers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse, constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups. Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 04:32:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21887</guid></item><item><title>Universal Reasoner: A Single, Composable Plug-and-Play Reasoner for
  Frozen LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19075</link><description>UniR, a lightweight reasoning module, enhances Large Language Models with specialized reasoning abilities through modular composition, improving performance and generalization at lower computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

  Diffusion?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22129</link><description>Analysis of fine-tuning diffusion models for panoramic image generation reveals distinct roles of attention module matrices and introduces UniPano, a memory-efficient and speed-enhanced baseline framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent prosperity of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, has stimulated research to adapt them to 360-degree panorama generation. Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation techniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images. However, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images raises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical success. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit distinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation conceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the pre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains, thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant baseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but also significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior dual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation with higher resolution. The code will be released.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 04:08:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22129</guid></item><item><title>WebDancer: Towards Autonomous Information Seeking Agency</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22648</link><description>The paper proposes a framework for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents through a combination of data construction, trajectory sampling, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, showcasing its effectiveness on information seeking benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models.

  Scaling</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19187</link><description>A framework called PIR refines the importance of reasoning steps in large language models by pruning low-importance functional elements, leading to more concise reasoning chains with improved accuracy and reduced computational demands.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:35:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19187</guid></item><item><title>Towards Dynamic Theory of Mind: Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Temporal
  Evolution of Human States</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17663</link><description>The DynToM benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to track and understand the temporal progression of mental states, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present DynToM, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:35:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17663</guid></item><item><title>Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22202</link><description>Pretrained language models can adapt to operate in sentence space, reason over structured semantic units, and achieve competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought while reducing inference-time FLOPs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 05:30:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22202</guid></item><item><title>VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich
  Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22019</link><description>VRAG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework, enhances reasoning and visual information handling in RAG methods by integrating visual perception tokens and employing specialized action spaces and rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications.

AI-generated summary 				 A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally, we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring.

  Guidance</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21876</link><description>EPiC is a framework for efficient 3D camera control in video diffusion models that constructs high-quality anchor videos through first-frame visibility masking, integrates them using a lightweight ControlNet module, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on I2V tasks with minimal resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent approaches on 3D camera control in video diffusion models (VDMs) often create anchor videos to guide diffusion models as a structured prior by rendering from estimated point clouds following annotated camera trajectories. However, errors inherent in point cloud estimation often lead to inaccurate anchor videos. Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory annotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations, we introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework that automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive camera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor videos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility. This approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory annotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to generate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce Anchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor video guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of backbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and ControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer parameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to the diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering misalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our method generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during inference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control. EPiC achieves SOTA performance on RealEstate10K and MiraData for I2V camera control task, demonstrating precise and robust camera control ability both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, EPiC also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to video-to-video scenarios.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 03:45:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21876</guid></item><item><title>RICO: Improving Accuracy and Completeness in Image Recaptioning via
  Visual Reconstruction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22613</link><description>A novel iterative framework, RICO, improves image caption accuracy by using visual reconstruction and a text-to-image model to refine discrepancies, while RICO-Flash enhances efficiency using DPO.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image recaptioning is widely used to generate training datasets with enhanced quality for various multimodal tasks. Existing recaptioning methods typically rely on powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance textual descriptions, but often suffer from inaccuracies due to hallucinations and incompleteness caused by missing fine-grained details. To address these limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves caption accuracy and completeness, outperforms most baselines by approximately 10% on both CapsBench and CompreCap.

AI-generated summary 				 We present Thinking with Generated Images, a novel paradigm that fundamentally transforms how large multimodal models (LMMs) engage with visual reasoning by enabling them to natively think across text and vision modalities through spontaneous generation of intermediate visual thinking steps. Current visual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed user-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive capability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts, critique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of their reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate visual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable components that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision generation with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual hypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce refined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision generation benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches, with our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in handling complex multi-object scenarios. From biochemists exploring novel protein structures, and architects iterating on spatial designs, to forensic analysts reconstructing crime scenes, and basketball players envisioning strategic plays, our approach enables AI models to engage in the kind of visual imagination and iterative refinement that characterizes human creative, analytical, and strategic thinking.

  Generative Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22523</link><description>The work introduces a dataset and model for generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images using diffusion models and a novel synthesis pipeline.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images from text prompts can unlock a new level of creative control, allowing users to edit each layer as effortlessly as editing text outputs from LLMs. However, the development of multi-layer generative models lags behind that of conventional text-to-image models due to the absence of a large, high-quality corpus of multi-layer transparent data. In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i) releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro) dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes, (ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong, open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model. We anticipate that our work will establish a solid dataset foundation for the multi-layer transparent image generation task, enabling research and applications that require precise, editable, and visually compelling layered imagery.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:10:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22523</guid></item><item><title>Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22338</link><description>Text2Grad converts human textual feedback into span-level gradients to optimize language models precisely and efficiently.  					AI-generated summary 				 Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful signal for fine-grained policy optimization.

  Vision, Language to Multimodality</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18227</link><description>Token reduction in Transformer models, beyond efficiency, enhances multimodal integration, reduces hallucinations, and improves training stability in generative modeling.  					AI-generated summary 				 In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 13:56:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18227</guid></item><item><title>Pitfalls of Rule- and Model-based Verifiers -- A Case Study on
  Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22203</link><description>The study examines the effectiveness and reliability of rule-based and model-based verifiers in reinforcement learning with verifiable reward, highlighting limitations and vulnerabilities in their use for mathematical reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct (i.e., false positives). This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique risks inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers, aiming to offer valuable insights to develop more robust reward systems in reinforcement learning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 04:07:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22203</guid></item><item><title>GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language
  Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18700</link><description>The GRE Suite enhances Visual Language Models with structured reasoning chains, improving geo-localization tasks through a multi-stage strategy and comprehensive evaluation benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference.

  Falsehoods</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17870</link><description>A generative AI model is fine-tuned with labeled falsehoods to reduce misinformation generation, analogous to biological immunization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative AI models often learn and reproduce false information present in their training corpora. This position paper argues that, analogous to biological immunization, where controlled exposure to a weakened pathogen builds immunity, AI models should be fine tuned on small, quarantined sets of explicitly labeled falsehoods as a "vaccine" against misinformation. These curated false examples are periodically injected during finetuning, strengthening the model ability to recognize and reject misleading claims while preserving accuracy on truthful inputs. An illustrative case study shows that immunized models generate substantially less misinformation than baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first training framework that treats fact checked falsehoods themselves as a supervised vaccine, rather than relying on input perturbations or generic human feedback signals, to harden models against future misinformation. We also outline ethical safeguards and governance controls to ensure the safe use of false data. Model immunization offers a proactive paradigm for aligning AI systems with factuality.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 05:38:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.17870</guid></item><item><title>One-Way Ticket:Time-Independent Unified Encoder for Distilling

AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generative modeling; however, they face a trade-off between inference speed and image quality, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing distilled T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results while maintaining the computational efficiency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 04:14:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21960</guid></item><item><title>MangaVQA and MangaLMM: A Benchmark and Specialized Model for Multimodal

AI-generated summary 				 Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 11:21:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20298</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking Recommendation, Classification, and Tracing Based on

  Cortex</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.15813</link><description>BraInCoRL employs a transformer-based in-context learning approach to model higher visual cortex neural responses with few-shot examples, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across new subjects, stimuli, and datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:15:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.15813</guid></item><item><title>Safe-Sora: Safe Text-to-Video Generation via Graphical Watermarking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12667</link><description>Safe-Sora embeds invisible watermarks into AI-generated videos using a hierarchical adaptive matching mechanism and a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture, achieving top performance in video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 03:00:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12667</guid></item><item><title>Characterizing Bias: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Simplified
  versus Traditional Chinese</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22645</link><description>Research examines LLM performance biases between Simplified and Traditional Chinese in regional term and name choice tasks, attributing differences to training data and tokenization.  					AI-generated summary 				 While the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, it is yet unclear whether LLMs exhibit differential performance when prompted in these two variants of written Chinese. This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities, we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to differently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading commercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese. These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such, we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants (https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 04:03:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22645</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling Instruction-Specific Neurons &amp; Experts: An Analytical

AI-generated summary 				 The finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced their instruction-following capabilities, yet the underlying computational mechanisms driving these improvements remain poorly understood. This study systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality, uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution. By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM community.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 06:25:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21191</guid></item><item><title>Styl3R: Instant 3D Stylized Reconstruction for Arbitrary Scenes and
  Styles</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21060</link><description>A novel feed-forward model achieves fast 3D stylization using sparse view images, maintaining multi-view consistency and high-quality style transfer while retaining reconstruction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms of multi-view consistency and efficiency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 08:19:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21060</guid></item><item><title>AITEE -- Agentic Tutor for Electrical Engineering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21582</link><description>An agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering enhances learning through natural circuit interaction, context-retrieving generation, and guided questioning, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning. AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies. The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance. Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable, personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering education.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:48:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.21582</guid></item><item><title>MUSEG: Reinforcing Video Temporal Understanding via Timestamp-Aware
  Multi-Segment Grounding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20715</link><description>MUSEG, an RL-based method with timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding, significantly enhances the temporal understanding of large language models by improving alignment with video segments and demonstrating superior performance in temporal reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse temporal understanding scenarios.

  Prediction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20589</link><description>Prot2Token unifies protein prediction tasks using an autoregressive decoder with task tokens, improving efficiency and accuracy across different benchmarks compared to specialized models.  					AI-generated summary 				 The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated specialized models, hindering the development of broadly applicable and computationally efficient Protein Language Models (PLMs). In this work, we introduce Prot2Token, a unified framework that overcomes these challenges by converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions, from sequence-level properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein interactions, into a standardized next-token prediction format. At its core, Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task learning, enabling a single model to master numerous tasks with improved efficiency. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Tokens strong predictive power in different types of protein-prediction tasks. Key results include significant speedups (e.g., near 1000x over AlphaFold2 with MSA) and performance often matching or exceeding specialized approaches. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a significant step towards a versatile, high-throughput paradigm for protein modeling, promising to accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics.

AI-generated summary 				 Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel, mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce computational cost, we propose a landmark-based approximation: influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU, across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 3.5times faster selection.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 11:00:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.19051</guid></item><item><title>Hard Negative Mining for Domain-Specific Retrieval in Enterprise Systems</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18366</link><description>Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate, domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed re-ranking models.   Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability and readiness for real-world applications.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 17:09:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18366</guid></item><item><title>Zero-Shot Vision Encoder Grafting via LLM Surrogates</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22664</link><description>The approach of training vision encoders with small surrogate models before transferring them to large language models reduces training costs and enhances performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 14:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.22664</guid></item><item><title>HoPE: Hybrid of Position Embedding for Length Generalization in
  Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20444</link><description>HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding, enhances VLMs' long-context performance in videos through improved frequency allocation and dynamic temporal scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness.

  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18149</link><description>First Finish Search improves accuracy in large language models by stopping inference at the first completed sample, significantly outperforming other decoding strategies in reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches n independent samples and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves 82.23% accuracy on the AIME datasets, a 15% improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at inference time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:45:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.18149</guid></item></channel></rss>
