AI-generated summary 				 Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust choice for LLM optimization.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:22:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01049</guid></item><item><title>Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective
  Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01939</link><description>Token entropy patterns are crucial in RLVR, with high-entropy tokens significantly impacting reasoning performance and model optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 04:39:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01939</guid></item><item><title>DyePack: Provably Flagging Test Set Contamination in LLMs Using
  Backdoors</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23001</link><description>DyePack, a framework using backdoor attacks, identifies models that leveraged benchmark test sets during training by introducing benign backdoor samples, ensuring precise false positive rates while preventing false accusations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 01:46:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23001</guid></item><item><title>Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative
  Trajectory Control</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01943</link><description>A novel framework, RoboMaster, enhances trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation by modeling inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Bridge V2 dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:27:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01943</guid></item><item><title>ARIA: Training Language Agents with Intention-Driven Reward Aggregation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00539</link><description>ARIA aggregates rewards in an intention space to mitigate reward sparsity and improve policy optimization in language-based reinforcement learning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 04:20:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00539</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning Like an Economist: Post-Training on Economic Problems Induces
  Strategic Generalization in LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00577</link><description>Post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards improve the reasoning and economic rationality of Large Language Models in multi-agent scenarios through domain-aligned training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively generalize to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a testbed, leveraging its strong foundations in mathematics and game theory, its demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis. We introduce Recon (Reasoning like an ECONomist), a 7B-parameter open-source LLM post-trained on a hand-curated dataset of 2,100 high-quality economic reasoning problems. Comprehensive evaluation on economic reasoning benchmarks and multi-agent games reveals clear improvements in structured reasoning and economic rationality. These results underscore the promise of domain-aligned post-training for enhancing reasoning and agent alignment, shedding light on the roles of SFT and RL in shaping model behavior.

  Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01881</link><description>STORM frameworks facilitates collaborative intent formation in task-oriented dialogue systems by modeling asymmetric information dynamics between UserLLM and AgentLLM.  					AI-generated summary 				 Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:08:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01881</guid></item><item><title>VisualSphinx: Large-Scale Synthetic Vision Logic Puzzles for RL</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23977</link><description>VisualSphinx provides a large-scale synthetic dataset to improve multimodal reasoning in vision language models, enhancing performance on various logical reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal reasoning and make logically coherent decisions, which is critical to tasks such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic visual logical reasoning training data. To tackle the challenge of image synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:38:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23977</guid></item><item><title>Cora: Correspondence-aware image editing using few step diffusion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23907</link><description>Cora framework enhances image editing through correspondence-aware noise correction and interpolated attention maps, excelling in structure and texture preservation and generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image editing is an important task in computer graphics, vision, and VFX, with recent diffusion-based methods achieving fast and high-quality results. However, edits requiring significant structural changes, such as non-rigid deformations, object modifications, or content generation, remain challenging. Existing few step editing approaches produce artifacts such as irrelevant texture or struggle to preserve key attributes of the source image (e.g., pose). We introduce Cora, a novel editing framework that addresses these limitations by introducing correspondence-aware noise correction and interpolated attention maps. Our method aligns textures and structures between the source and target images through semantic correspondence, enabling accurate texture transfer while generating new content when necessary. Cora offers control over the balance between content generation and preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, quantitatively and qualitatively, Cora excels in maintaining structure, textures, and identity across diverse edits, including pose changes, object addition, and texture refinements. User studies confirm that Cora delivers superior results, outperforming alternatives.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:21:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23907</guid></item><item><title>VAU-R1: Advancing Video Anomaly Understanding via Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23504</link><description>VAU-R1 uses Multimodal Large Language Models with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance video anomaly reasoning, complemented by VAU-Bench, a Chain-of-Thought benchmark for evaluating anomaly understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection, existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1, a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales, temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding, and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware video anomaly understanding.

  in Information Retrieval</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23059</link><description>State Machine Reasoning (SMR) improves information retrieval performance and reduces token usage in large language models by addressing overthinking through a discrete action framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However, it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:12:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23059</guid></item><item><title>SATA-BENCH: Select All That Apply Benchmark for Multiple Choice
  Questions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00643</link><description>SATA-BENCH evaluates LLMs on multi-answer questions, revealing selections biases and proposing Choice Funnel to improve accuracy and reduce costs in multi-answer reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:52:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00643</guid></item><item><title>Learning from Videos for 3D World: Enhancing MLLMs with 3D Vision
  Geometry Priors</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24625</link><description>A novel Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM) extracts 3D information directly from video sequences to enhance 3D scene understanding without additional 3D data, achieving competitive results in various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 01:54:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24625</guid></item><item><title>OWSM v4: Improving Open Whisper-Style Speech Models via Data Scaling and
  Cleaning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00338</link><description>The OWSM project is enhanced with a large-scale, cleaned web dataset, leading to improved multilingual speech models comparable to leading industrial models.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the ESPnet toolkit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:09:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00338</guid></item><item><title>MiCRo: Mixture Modeling and Context-aware Routing for Personalized
  Preference Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24846</link><description>MiCRo, a two-stage framework, improves personalized preference learning for large language models by leveraging binary preference datasets and dynamically adapting mixture weights based on context, effectively capturing diverse human preferences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment. Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error. While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values. In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:21:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24846</guid></item><item><title>REASONING GYM: Reasoning Environments for Reinforcement Learning with

AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Reasoning Gym (RG), a library of reasoning environments for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. It provides over 100 data generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra, arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement learning of reasoning models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:32:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24760</guid></item><item><title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large
  Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01413</link><description>A method is proposed to enhance large language models in handling complex instructions through incentivized reasoning and reinforcement learning, improving performance and reducing computational load.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00996</link><description>Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT) enhances pretrained video diffusion models for diverse conditional generation tasks with minimal data and without architectural changes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

  Jigsaw Puzzles</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.23590</link><description>Rule-based reinforcement learning applied to multimodal large language models demonstrates effective generalization in visual tasks, particularly using jigsaw puzzles, outperforming supervised fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: Firstly, we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. Secondly, training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. Thirdly, MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. Fourthly, we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. Finally, our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.
