To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective temporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video sequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE, an test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling extrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long short-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:07:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19325</guid></item><item><title>CoMP: Continual Multimodal Pre-training for Vision Foundation Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18931</link><description>Pre-trained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong visual representations for a wide range of applications. In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:40:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18931</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Hallucination of Large Multimodal Models in Video
  Understanding: Benchmark, Analysis and Mitigation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19622</link><description>The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 03:14:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19622</guid></item><item><title>Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and
  Rollover Budget Forcing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19385</link><description>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:19:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19385</guid></item><item><title>Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection
  with Artifact Explanation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14905</link><description>With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection. Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection. The dataset and code will be released in: https://github.com/opendatalab/FakeVLM.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:55:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14905</guid></item><item><title>Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19903</link><description>High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 03:43:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19903</guid></item><item><title>Think Twice: Enhancing LLM Reasoning by Scaling Multi-round Test-time
  Thinking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19855</link><description>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques. The key prompt: {Original question prompt} The assistant's previous answer is: &lt;answer&gt; {last round answer} &lt;/answer&gt;, and please re-answer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:34:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19855</guid></item><item><title>CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19910</link><description>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 01:56:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19910</guid></item><item><title>Latent Space Super-Resolution for Higher-Resolution Image Generation
  with Diffusion Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18446</link><description>In this paper, we propose LSRNA, a novel framework for higher-resolution (exceeding 1K) image generation using diffusion models by leveraging super-resolution directly in the latent space. Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness. The code is available at https://github.com/3587jjh/LSRNA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18446</guid></item><item><title>MDocAgent: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document
  Understanding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13964</link><description>Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a very common task. Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of our MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information.

  Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19470</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:26:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19470</guid></item><item><title>LookAhead Tuning: Safer Language Models via Partial Answer Previews</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19041</link><description>Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often undermines their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, which comprises two simple, low-resource, and effective data-driven methods that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes. Both methods aim to preserve the model's inherent safety mechanisms by minimizing perturbations to initial token distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LookAheadTuning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 01:52:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19041</guid></item><item><title>Frequency Dynamic Convolution for Dense Image Prediction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18783</link><description>While Dynamic Convolution (DY-Conv) has shown promising performance by enabling adaptive weight selection through multiple parallel weights combined with an attention mechanism, the frequency response of these weights tends to exhibit high similarity, resulting in high parameter costs but limited adaptability. In this work, we introduce Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDConv), a novel approach that mitigates these limitations by learning a fixed parameter budget in the Fourier domain. FDConv divides this budget into frequency-based groups with disjoint Fourier indices, enabling the construction of frequency-diverse weights without increasing the parameter cost. To further enhance adaptability, we propose Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM). KSM dynamically adjusts the frequency response of each filter at the spatial level, while FBM decomposes weights into distinct frequency bands in the frequency domain and modulates them dynamically based on local content. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, and classification validate the effectiveness of FDConv. We demonstrate that when applied to ResNet-50, FDConv achieves superior performance with a modest increase of +3.6M parameters, outperforming previous methods that require substantial increases in parameter budgets (e.g., CondConv +90M, KW +76.5M). Moreover, FDConv seamlessly integrates into a variety of architectures, including ConvNeXt, Swin-Transformer, offering a flexible and efficient solution for modern vision tasks. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDConv.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 02:38:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18783</guid></item><item><title>Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching with Straight-Through Guidance for
  Controllable Biological Sequence Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17361</link><description>Flow matching in the continuous simplex has emerged as a promising strategy for DNA sequence design, but struggles to scale to higher simplex dimensions required for peptide and protein generation. We introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow and Score Matching, a generative framework on the simplex based on a novel Gumbel-Softmax interpolant with a time-dependent temperature. Using this interpolant, we introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching by deriving a parameterized velocity field that transports from smooth categorical distributions to distributions concentrated at a single vertex of the simplex. We alternatively present Gumbel-Softmax Score Matching which learns to regress the gradient of the probability density. Our framework enables high-quality, diverse generation and scales efficiently to higher-dimensional simplices. To enable training-free guidance, we propose Straight-Through Guided Flows (STGFlow), a classifier-based guidance method that leverages straight-through estimators to steer the unconditional velocity field toward optimal vertices of the simplex. STGFlow enables efficient inference-time guidance using classifiers pre-trained on clean sequences, and can be used with any discrete flow method. Together, these components form a robust framework for controllable de novo sequence generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in conditional DNA promoter design, sequence-only protein generation, and target-binding peptide design for rare disease treatment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 01:48:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17361</guid></item><item><title>Strong Baseline: Multi-UAV Tracking via YOLOv12 with BoT-SORT-ReID</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17237</link><description>Detecting and tracking multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in thermal infrared video is inherently challenging due to low contrast, environmental noise, and small target sizes. This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the YOLOv5 with the DeepSORT pipeline, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the metrics from the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge and demonstrate competitive performance. Notably, we achieve strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for the multi-UAV tracking task. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements.

  Training For Human-Centered Decision Making</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16965</link><description>Embodied decision-making is fundamental for AI agents operating in real-world environments. While Visual Language Models (VLMs) have advanced this capability, they still struggle with complex decisions, particularly in human-centered situations that require deep reasoning about human needs and values. In this study, we systematically evaluate open-sourced VLMs on multimodal human-centered decision-making tasks. We find that LLMs receiving only textual descriptions unexpectedly outperform their VLM counterparts of similar scale that process actual images, suggesting that visual alignment may hinder VLM abilities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-only training approach with synthesized textual data. This method strengthens VLMs' language components and transfers the learned abilities to multimodal inference, eliminating the need for expensive image-text paired data. Furthermore, we show that VLMs can achieve substantial performance gains through self-improvement, using training data generated by their LLM counterparts rather than relying on larger teacher models like GPT-4. Our findings establish a more efficient and scalable approach to enhancing VLMs' human-centered decision-making capabilities, opening new avenues for optimizing VLMs through self-improvement mechanisms.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 01:50:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16965</guid></item></channel></rss>
