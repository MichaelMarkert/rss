Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to TC^0. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.   To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0 License.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 01:59:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14456</guid></item><item><title>Impossible Videos</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14378</link><description>Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 01:41:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14378</guid></item><item><title>Creation-MMBench: Assessing Context-Aware Creative Intelligence in MLLM</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14478</link><description>Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to generate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence. Full data and evaluation code is released on https://github.com/open-compass/Creation-MMBench.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 03:10:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14478</guid></item><item><title>DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476</link><description>Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:26:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476</guid></item><item><title>DeepPerception: Advancing R1-like Cognitive Visual Perception in MLLMs
  for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Grounding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12797</link><description>Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research. The data, codes, and models are released at https://github.com/thunlp/DeepPerception.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:36:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12797</guid></item><item><title>CapArena: Benchmarking and Analyzing Detailed Image Captioning in the
  LLM Era</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12329</link><description>Image captioning has been a longstanding challenge in vision-language research. With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast, VLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model levels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and efficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3% correlation with human rankings at just $4 per test. Data and resources will be open-sourced at https://caparena.github.io.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 03:34:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12329</guid></item><item><title>Infinite Mobility: Scalable High-Fidelity Synthesis of Articulated
  Objects via Procedural Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13424</link><description>Large-scale articulated objects with high quality are desperately needed for multiple tasks related to embodied AI. Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

Hyper-Connections recently generalized residual connections by introducing multiple connection strengths at different depths, thereby addressing the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. However, Hyper-Connections increase memory access costs by expanding the width of hidden states. In this paper, we propose Frac-Connections, a novel approach that divides hidden states into multiple parts rather than expanding their width. Frac-Connections retain partial benefits of Hyper-Connections while reducing memory consumption. To validate their effectiveness, we conduct large-scale experiments on language tasks, with the largest being a 7B MoE model trained on up to 3T tokens, demonstrating that Frac-Connections significantly outperform residual connections.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 01:39:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14125</guid></item><item><title>MPBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Process
  Errors Identification</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12505</link><description>Reasoning is an essential capacity for large language models (LLMs) to address complex tasks, where the identification of process errors is vital for improving this ability. Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answer Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions and selects the best one; and (3) Reasoning Process Search, which guides the search for optimal reasoning steps during inference. Through these paradigms, MPBench makes comprehensive evaluations and provides insights into the development of multimodal PRMs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 01:46:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12505</guid></item><item><title>Aligning Multimodal LLM with Human Preference: A Survey</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14504</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:40:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14499</guid></item><item><title>Temporal Consistency for LLM Reasoning Process Error Identification</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14495</link><description>Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1.

  Control</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14492</link><description>We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI, including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack. To help accelerate research development in the field, we open-source our models and code at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:33:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14492</guid></item><item><title>PEBench: A Fictitious Dataset to Benchmark Machine Unlearning for
  Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12545</link><description>In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in tasks such as visual question answering, visual understanding, and reasoning. However, this impressive progress relies on vast amounts of data collected from the internet, raising significant concerns about privacy and security. To address these issues, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the removal of specific knowledge from an already trained model without requiring retraining from scratch. Although MU for MLLMs has gained attention, current evaluations of its efficacy remain incomplete, and the underlying problem is often poorly defined, which hinders the development of strategies for creating more secure and trustworthy systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce a benchmark, named PEBench, which includes a dataset of personal entities and corresponding general event scenes, designed to comprehensively assess the performance of MU for MLLMs. Through PEBench, we aim to provide a standardized and robust framework to advance research in secure and privacy-preserving multimodal models. We benchmarked 6 MU methods, revealing their strengths and limitations, and shedding light on key challenges and opportunities for MU in MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 01:44:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12545</guid></item><item><title>Concat-ID: Towards Universal Identity-Preserving Video Synthesis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14151</link><description>We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video generation. Concat-ID employs Variational Autoencoders to extract image features, which are concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension, leveraging solely 3D self-attention mechanisms without the need for additional modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:27:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14151</guid></item><item><title>Pensez: Less Data, Better Reasoning -- Rethinking French LLM</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13661</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, achieving strong performance in specialized domains like mathematical reasoning and non-English languages often requires extensive training on massive datasets. This paper investigates a contrasting approach: strategic fine-tuning on a small, high-quality, bilingual (English-French) dataset to enhance both the reasoning capabilities and French language proficiency of a large language model. Rather than relying on scale, we explore the hypothesis that targeted data curation and optimized training can achieve competitive, or even superior, performance. We demonstrate, through targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on only 2,000 carefully selected samples, significant improvements in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, Pensez 7B exhibits an increase in accuracy of the base model up to 20% on the AIME25 and a 12% increase on a French MATH level 5 benchmark. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that massive datasets are aprerequisite for strong reasoning performance in LLMs, highlighting the potential of strategic data curation and optimized fine-tuning for enhancing both specialized skills and multilingual capabilities. Our findings have implications for the efficient development of high-performing, multilingual LLMs, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:13:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13661</guid></item><item><title>Reflect-DiT: Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion
  Transformers via In-Context Reflection</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12271</link><description>The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 03:38:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12271</guid></item><item><title>Hyperbolic Safety-Aware Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12127</link><description>Addressing the retrieval of unsafe content from vision-language models such as CLIP is an important step towards real-world integration. Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enhances safety recognition but also establishes a more adaptable and interpretable framework for content moderation in vision-language models.

  Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10546</link><description>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), significant progress has been made in developing open-vocabulary robotic manipulation systems. However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a keypoint-based target specification is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

  Simulation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10410</link><description>Roadside Collaborative Perception refers to a system where multiple roadside units collaborate to pool their perceptual data, assisting vehicles in enhancing their environmental awareness. Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation.
