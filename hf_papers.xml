AI-generated summary 				 Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:28:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24668</guid></item><item><title>Tongyi DeepResearch Technical Report</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24701</link><description>Tongyi DeepResearch, a large language model with agentic capabilities, achieves top performance in various deep research tasks through an end-to-end training framework and automated data synthesis.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Tongyi DeepResearch, an agentic large language model, which is specifically designed for long-horizon, deep information-seeking research tasks. To incentivize autonomous deep research agency, Tongyi DeepResearch is developed through an end-to-end training framework that combines agentic mid-training and agentic post-training, enabling scalable reasoning and information seeking across complex tasks. We design a highly scalable data synthesis pipeline that is fully automatic, without relying on costly human annotation, and empowers all training stages.

AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:35:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.23763</guid></item><item><title>Game-TARS: Pretrained Foundation Models for Scalable Generalist
  Multimodal Game Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.23691</link><description>Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified action space, achieves superior performance across various domains and benchmarks through large-scale pre-training and efficient reasoning strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:48:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.23691</guid></item><item><title>Group Relative Attention Guidance for Image Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24657</link><description>Group Relative Attention Guidance enhances image editing quality by modulating token deltas in Diffusion-in-Transformer models, providing fine-grained control over editing intensity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:36:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24657</guid></item><item><title>Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit
  Routing Guidance</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24711</link><description>ProMoE, an MoE framework with conditional and prototypical routing, enhances expert specialization in Diffusion Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be made publicly available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:51:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24711</guid></item><item><title>Critique-RL: Training Language Models for Critiquing through Two-Stage
  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24320</link><description>Critique-RL is an online reinforcement learning approach for developing critiquing language models without strong supervision, using a two-stage optimization strategy to improve both the critic's discriminability and helpfulness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:17:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24320</guid></item><item><title>Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal
  Reasoning in MLLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24514</link><description>Latent Sketchpad enhances Multimodal Large Language Models with an internal visual scratchpad, enabling generative visual thought and improved reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:18:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.23642</guid></item><item><title>ParallelMuse: Agentic Parallel Thinking for Deep Information Seeking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24698</link><description>ParallelMuse enhances problem-solving by efficiently reusing paths and compressing reasoning in deep information-seeking agents, improving performance and reducing token consumption.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in exploratory token consumption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:34:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24698</guid></item><item><title>AgentFold: Long-Horizon Web Agents with Proactive Context Management</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24699</link><description>AgentFold, a novel proactive context management paradigm for LLM-based web agents, achieves superior performance on long-horizon tasks through dynamic context folding, surpassing larger models and proprietary agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:33:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24699</guid></item><item><title>WebLeaper: Empowering Efficiency and Efficacy in WebAgent via Enabling
  Info-Rich Seeking</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24697</link><description>WebLeaper framework improves information seeking efficiency and effectiveness by constructing high-coverage tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories using tree-structured reasoning and curated Wikipedia tables.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24697</guid></item><item><title>Uniform Discrete Diffusion with Metric Path for Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24717</link><description>URSA, a discrete generative model, bridges the gap with continuous approaches in video generation by using a Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting, achieving high-resolution and long-duration synthesis with fewer inference steps.  					AI-generated summary 				 Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency. In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods.

  ZPD-Guided Data Synthesis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24695</link><description>A ZPD-guided data synthesis approach enhances large language model capabilities by training them on tasks just beyond their current abilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance on complex benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:37:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24695</guid></item><item><title>Repurposing Synthetic Data for Fine-grained Search Agent Supervision</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24694</link><description>Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO) enhances search agents by incorporating entity information into the reward function, improving accuracy and efficiency in knowledge-intensive tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:38:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24694</guid></item><item><title>STAR-Bench: Probing Deep Spatio-Temporal Reasoning as Audio 4D
  Intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24693</link><description>STAR-Bench measures audio 4D intelligence by evaluating sound dynamics in time and 3D space, revealing gaps in fine-grained perceptual reasoning among existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:46:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24693</guid></item><item><title>ATLAS: Adaptive Transfer Scaling Laws for Multilingual Pretraining,
  Finetuning, and Decoding the Curse of Multilinguality</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.22037</link><description>The study introduces ATLAS, a multilingual scaling law that improves out-of-sample generalization and provides insights into cross-lingual transfer, optimal scaling, and computational crossover points for model training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date, totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages, and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444 language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:46:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.22037</guid></item><item><title>FunReason-MT Technical Report: Overcoming the Complexity Barrier in
  Multi-Turn Function Calling</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24645</link><description>FunReason-MT is a novel data synthesis framework that enhances multi-turn function calling in large language models by addressing challenges in environment interaction, query synthesis, and chain-of-thought generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard.  					AI-generated summary 				 Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:45:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24645</guid></item><item><title>ReplicationBench: Can AI Agents Replicate Astrophysics Research Papers?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24591</link><description>ReplicationBench evaluates AI agents' ability to replicate astrophysics research papers, providing insights into their faithfulness and correctness in scientific research tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 01:50:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24591</guid></item><item><title>OSWorld-MCP: Benchmarking MCP Tool Invocation In Computer-Use Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24563</link><description>OSWorld-MCP is a benchmark that evaluates multimodal agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities, highlighting the importance of assessing tool usage in real-world scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP, the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted environments.

AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand, identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to enhancing LLM reliability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:05:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.22099</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking Visual Intelligence: Insights from Video Pretraining</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24448</link><description>Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) show higher data efficiency than large language models across various visual tasks, suggesting video pretraining can enhance visual foundation models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:20:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24448</guid></item><item><title>VL-SAE: Interpreting and Enhancing Vision-Language Alignment with a
  Unified Concept Set</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.21323</link><description>VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder, enhances vision-language alignment by correlating neurons to unified concepts, improving interpretability and performance in tasks like zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.  					AI-generated summary 				 The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.
