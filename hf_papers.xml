We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

  Autoregressive Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08736</link><description>In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to 3 space billion parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:27:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08736</guid></item><item><title>MineWorld: a Real-Time and Open-Source Interactive World Model on
  Minecraft</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08388</link><description>World modeling is a crucial task for enabling intelligent agents to effectively interact with humans and operate in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose MineWorld, a real-time interactive world model on Minecraft, an open-ended sandbox game which has been utilized as a common testbed for world modeling. MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive Transformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input, and generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by transforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an image tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model input with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is then trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game states as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In inference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the spatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in different scales generate 4 to 7 frames per second and enabling real-time interactions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess not only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating new scenes, which is crucial for a world model. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the efficacy of MineWorld, outperforming SoTA open-sourced diffusion based world models significantly. The code and model have been released.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 03:37:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08388</guid></item><item><title>SQL-R1: Training Natural Language to SQL Reasoning Model By
  Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08600</link><description>Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) enables intuitive interactions with databases by transforming natural language queries into structured SQL statements. Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the inference performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments (e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL. In existing experiments, SQL-R1 achieves execution accuracy of 88.6% and 66.6% on the benchmark Spider and BIRD, respectively, only using the 7B base model.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:37:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08600</guid></item><item><title>PixelFlow: Pixel-Space Generative Models with Flow</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07963</link><description>We present PixelFlow, a family of image generation models that operate directly in the raw pixel space, in contrast to the predominant latent-space models. This approach simplifies the image generation process by eliminating the need for a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and enabling the whole model end-to-end trainable. Through efficient cascade flow modeling, PixelFlow achieves affordable computation cost in pixel space. It achieves an FID of 1.98 on 256times256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark. The qualitative text-to-image results demonstrate that PixelFlow excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope this new paradigm will inspire and open up new opportunities for next-generation visual generation models.

  Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07405</link><description>With the rapid advancement of 2D generative models, preserving subject identity while enabling diverse editing has emerged as a critical research focus. Existing methods typically face inherent trade-offs between identity preservation and personalized manipulation. We introduce FlexIP, a novel framework that decouples these objectives through two dedicated components: a Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and a Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. By explicitly injecting both control mechanisms into the generative model, our framework enables flexible parameterized control during inference through dynamic tuning of the weight adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach breaks through the performance limitations of conventional methods, achieving superior identity preservation while supporting more diverse personalized generation capabilities (Project Page: https://flexip-tech.github.io/flexip/).</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 02:24:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07405</guid></item><item><title>ZipIR: Latent Pyramid Diffusion Transformer for High-Resolution Image
  Restoration</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08591</link><description>Recent progress in generative models has significantly improved image restoration capabilities, particularly through powerful diffusion models that offer remarkable recovery of semantic details and local fidelity. However, deploying these models at ultra-high resolutions faces a critical trade-off between quality and efficiency due to the computational demands of long-range attention mechanisms. To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:13:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08591</guid></item><item><title>In-2-4D: Inbetweening from Two Single-View Images to 4D Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08366</link><description>We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images capturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user study, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

  of Images</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08727</link><description>We present a system using Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to analyze a large database with tens of millions of images captured at different times, with the aim of discovering patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).

Examining Architecture and Data Influence on
  Transformer Encoder Models Performance</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08716</link><description>Pretrained transformer-encoder models like DeBERTaV3 and ModernBERT introduce architectural advancements aimed at improving efficiency and performance. Although the authors of ModernBERT report improved performance over DeBERTaV3 on several benchmarks, the lack of disclosed training data and the absence of comparisons using a shared dataset make it difficult to determine whether these gains are due to architectural improvements or differences in training data. In this work, we conduct a controlled study by pretraining ModernBERT on the same dataset as CamemBERTaV2, a DeBERTaV3 French model, isolating the effect of model design. Our results show that the previous model generation remains superior in sample efficiency and overall benchmark performance, with ModernBERT's primary advantage being faster training and inference speed. However, the new proposed model still provides meaningful architectural improvements compared to earlier models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Additionally, we observe that high-quality pre-training data accelerates convergence but does not significantly improve final performance, suggesting potential benchmark saturation. These findings show the importance of disentangling pretraining data from architectural innovations when evaluating transformer models.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:50:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08716</guid></item><item><title>Pangu Ultra: Pushing the Limits of Dense Large Language Models on Ascend
  NPUs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07866</link><description>We present Pangu Ultra, a Large Language Model (LLM) with 135 billion parameters and dense Transformer modules trained on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters. Our model and system will be available for our commercial customers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07866</guid></item><item><title>VLM-R1: A Stable and Generalizable R1-style Large Vision-Language Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07615</link><description>Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

Probing Rule Learning
  vs. Memorization in Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05262</link><description>Despite high benchmark scores, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail simple problem, raising a critical question: Do LLMs learn mathematical principles or merely memorize patterns? Rather than designing increasingly complex benchmarks like recent works, we investigate this using elementary two-integer addition (0 to 2^{64}), probing two core properties: commutativity (A+B=B+A) and compositional generalization (via isomorphic symbolic mappings, e.g., 7 rightarrow y). While state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 73.8-99.8\% accuracy on numerical addition, performance collapses to leq7.5\% under symbolic mapping, indicating failure to generalize learned rules. Non-monotonic performance scaling with digit count and frequent commutativity violations (over 1,700 cases of A+B neq B+A) further support this. Explicitly providing addition rules degrades performance by 81.2\% on average, while self-explanation maintains baseline accuracy, suggesting LLM arithmetic processing is misaligned with human-defined principles. Our findings indicate current LLMs rely on memory pattern over genuine rule learning, highlighting architectural limitations and the need for new approaches to achieve true mathematical reasoning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:41:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05262</guid></item><item><title>Training-free Guidance in Text-to-Video Generation via Multimodal
  Planning and Structured Noise Initialization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08641</link><description>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the visual quality of the generated videos. However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:13:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08641</guid></item><item><title>SAEs Can Improve Unlearning: Dynamic Sparse Autoencoder
  Guardrails for Precision Unlearning in LLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08192</link><description>Machine unlearning is a promising approach to improve LLM safety by removing unwanted knowledge from the model. However, prevailing gradient-based unlearning methods suffer from issues such as high computational costs, hyperparameter instability, poor sequential unlearning capability, vulnerability to relearning attacks, low data efficiency, and lack of interpretability. While Sparse Autoencoders are well-suited to improve these aspects by enabling targeted activation-based unlearning, prior approaches underperform gradient-based methods. This work demonstrates that, contrary to these earlier findings, SAEs can significantly improve unlearning when employed dynamically. We introduce Dynamic DAE Guardrails (DSG), a novel method for precision unlearning that leverages principled feature selection and a dynamic classifier. Our experiments show DSG substantially outperforms leading unlearning methods, achieving superior forget-utility trade-offs. DSG addresses key drawbacks of gradient-based approaches for unlearning -- offering enhanced computational efficiency and stability, robust performance in sequential unlearning, stronger resistance to relearning attacks, better data efficiency including zero-shot settings, and more interpretable unlearning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:04:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08192</guid></item><item><title>CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01883</link><description>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, especially under few-shot learning constraints. We introduce CoRAG, a framework extending RAG to collaborative settings, where clients jointly train a shared model using a collaborative passage store. To evaluate CoRAG, we introduce CRAB, a benchmark for collaborative homogeneous open-domain question answering. Our experiments demonstrate that CoRAG consistently outperforms both parametric collaborative learning methods and locally trained RAG models in low-resource scenarios. Further analysis reveals the critical importance of relevant passages within the shared store, the surprising benefits of incorporating irrelevant passages, and the potential for hard negatives to negatively impact performance. This introduces a novel consideration in collaborative RAG: the trade-off between leveraging a collectively enriched knowledge base and the potential risk of incorporating detrimental passages from other clients. Our findings underscore the viability of CoRAG, while also highlighting key design challenges and promising avenues for future research.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:11:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01883</guid></item><item><title>Latent Diffusion Autoencoders: Toward Efficient and Meaningful
  Unsupervised Representation Learning in Medical Imaging</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08635</link><description>This study presents Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a novel encoder-decoder diffusion-based framework for efficient and meaningful unsupervised learning in medical imaging, focusing on Alzheimer disease (AD) using brain MR from the ADNI database as a case study. Unlike conventional diffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion process in a compressed latent representation, improving computational efficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To validate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR associated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction while being computationally efficient. Experimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations demonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%) and age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic representations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible modifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong reconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month gap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance (SSIM &gt; 0.93, MSE &lt; 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal progression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE significantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing reconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework for scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a foundation model for medical image analysis.

This is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. Existing methods rely on 3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or tedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome this, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly applying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while human-object contact is inherently 3D. Thus we introduce a novel Render-Localize-Lift module that: (1) embeds 3D body and object surfaces in 2D space via multi-view rendering, (2) trains a novel multi-view localization model (MV-Loc) to infer contacts in 2D, and (3) lifts these to 3D. Additionally, we propose a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling. InteractVLM outperforms existing work on contact estimation and also facilitates 3D reconstruction from an in-the wild image.
