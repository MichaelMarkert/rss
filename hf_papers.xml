AI-generated summary 				 The diversity of post-training data is critical for effective downstream performance in large language models (LLMs). Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 03:06:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.10388</guid></item><item><title>MedXIAOHE: A Comprehensive Recipe for Building Medical MLLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12705</link><description>MedXIAOHE is a medical vision-language foundation model that enhances clinical understanding through entity-aware continual pretraining, reinforcement learning, and tool-augmented agentic training for reliable diagnostic reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present MedXIAOHE, a medical vision-language foundation model designed to advance general-purpose medical understanding and reasoning in real-world clinical applications. MedXIAOHE achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical benchmarks and surpasses leading closed-source multimodal systems on multiple capabilities. To achieve this, we propose an entity-aware continual pretraining framework that organizes heterogeneous medical corpora to broaden knowledge coverage and reduce long-tail gaps (e.g., rare diseases). For medical expert-level reasoning and interaction, MedXIAOHE incorporates diverse medical reasoning patterns via reinforcement learning and tool-augmented agentic training, enabling multi-step diagnostic reasoning with verifiable decision traces. To improve reliability in real-world use, MedXIAOHE integrates user-preference rubrics, evidence-grounded reasoning, and low-hallucination long-form report generation, with improved adherence to medical instructions. We release this report to document our practical design choices, scaling insights, and evaluation framework, hoping to inspire further research.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 02:35:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12705</guid></item><item><title>Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11858</link><description>Region-to-Image Distillation enables fine-grained visual perception in MLLMs by training models to internally perform iterative zooming during inference, eliminating the need for repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding while maintaining high performance across multiple benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

AI-generated summary 				 Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.   Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.   Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:40:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08683</guid></item><item><title>CoPE-VideoLM: Codec Primitives For Efficient Video Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.13191</link><description>Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to 86% and token usage by up to 93% compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on 14 diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 04:23:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.13191</guid></item><item><title>GeoAgent: Learning to Geolocate Everywhere with Reinforced Geographic Characteristics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12617</link><description>GeoAgent achieves superior geolocation reasoning performance through a specialized dataset and reward mechanisms that ensure geographic accuracy and reasoning consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents GeoAgent, a model capable of reasoning closely with humans and deriving fine-grained address conclusions. Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and a series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 02:37:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12617</guid></item><item><title>SQuTR: A Robustness Benchmark for Spoken Query to Text Retrieval under Acoustic Noise</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12783</link><description>Spoken query retrieval is an important interaction mode in modern information retrieval. However, existing evaluation datasets are often limited to simple queries under constrained noise conditions, making them inadequate for assessing the robustness of spoken query retrieval systems under complex acoustic perturbations. To address this limitation, we present SQuTR, a robustness benchmark for spoken query retrieval that includes a large-scale dataset and a unified evaluation protocol. SQuTR aggregates 37,317 unique queries from six commonly used English and Chinese text retrieval datasets, spanning multiple domains and diverse query types. We synthesize speech using voice profiles from 200 real speakers and mix 17 categories of real-world environmental noise under controlled SNR levels, enabling reproducible robustness evaluation from quiet to highly noisy conditions. Under the unified protocol, we conduct large-scale evaluations on representative cascaded and end-to-end retrieval systems. Experimental results show that retrieval performance decreases as noise increases, with substantially different drops across systems. Even large-scale retrieval models struggle under extreme noise, indicating that robustness remains a critical bottleneck. Overall, SQuTR provides a reproducible testbed for benchmarking and diagnostic analysis, and facilitates future research on robustness in spoken query to text retrieval.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:02:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12783</guid></item><item><title>What does RL improve for Visual Reasoning? A Frankenstein-Style Analysis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12395</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 04:03:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12395</guid></item><item><title>RLinf-Co: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12628</link><description>Reinforcement learning-based sim-real co-training framework improves vision-language-action policy performance through interactive simulation and real-world data anchoring.  					AI-generated summary 				 Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \textit{RL}-based sim-real \textit{Co}-training (RL-Co) framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and π_{0.5}, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on π_{0.5}. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:19:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12628</guid></item><item><title>ABot-M0: VLA Foundation Model for Robotic Manipulation with Action Manifold Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11236</link><description>ABot-M0 presents a unified framework for embodied agent development that standardizes diverse robotic data and employs action manifold learning to improve prediction efficiency and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:48:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11236</guid></item><item><title>Towards Universal Video MLLMs with Attribute-Structured and Quality-Verified Instructions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.13013</link><description>A large-scale dataset and model for fine-grained audiovisual understanding are introduced, demonstrating improved caption quality and reduced hallucinations through structured annotations and supervised fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal video understanding requires modeling fine-grained visual and audio information over time in diverse real-world scenarios. However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 02:46:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.13013</guid></item><item><title>Intelligent AI Delegation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11865</link><description>AI agents require adaptive frameworks for task decomposition and delegation that can dynamically respond to environmental changes and handle unexpected failures through structured authority transfer and trust mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 21:28:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11865</guid></item><item><title>BPDQ: Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization on a Variable Grid for Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.04163</link><description>Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ) improves low-bit quantization by using variable quantization grids derived from bit-planes and scalar coefficients, achieving better accuracy than traditional methods in resource-constrained LLM inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization a fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

AI-generated summary 				 Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:08:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12829</guid></item><item><title>On Robustness and Chain-of-Thought Consistency of RL-Finetuned VLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12506</link><description></description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:41:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12506</guid></item><item><title>DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11715</link><description>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for CUDA kernel generation achieve superior performance through a specialized dataset and reinforcement learning framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:38:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11715</guid></item><item><title>SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12984</link><description>SciAgentGym and SciAgentBench enable evaluation of scientific tool-use capabilities, while SciForge improves agent performance through dependency graph modeling of tool interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scientific reasoning inherently demands integrating sophisticated toolkits to navigate domain-specific knowledge. Yet, current benchmarks largely overlook agents' ability to orchestrate tools for such rigorous workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym, a scalable interactive environment featuring 1,780 domain-specific tools across four natural science disciplines, supported by a robust execution infrastructure. Complementing this, we present SciAgentBench, a tiered evaluation suite designed to stress-test agentic capabilities from elementary actions to long-horizon workflows. Our evaluation identifies a critical bottleneck: state-of-the-art models struggle with complex scientific tool-use. Even for a leading model like GPT-5, success rates drop sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons extend, primarily due to failures in multi-step workflow execution. To address this, we propose SciForge, a data synthesis method that models the tool action space as a dependency graph to generate logic-aware training trajectories. By fine-tuning on these trajectories, our SciAgent-8B outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct while exhibiting positive cross-domain transfer of scientific tool-use capabilities. These results underscore the promising potential of next-generation autonomous scientific agents.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:02:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12984</guid></item><item><title>Code2Worlds: Empowering Coding LLMs for 4D World Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11757</link><description>Code2Worlds enables 4D dynamic scene generation by formulating it as language-to-simulation code generation with a dual-stream architecture and physics-aware closed-loop refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

However, automatically separating the crowns from each other in aerial imagery is challenging due to factors such as the texture and partial tree crown overlaps. In this study, we present a method to train deep learning models that segment and separate individual trees from RGB and multispectral images, using pseudo-labels derived from aerial laser scanning (ALS) data. Our study shows that the ALS-derived pseudo-labels can be enhanced using a zero-shot instance segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Our method offers a way to obtain domain-specific training annotations for optical image-based models without any manual annotation cost, leading to segmentation models which outperform any available models which have been targeted for general domain deployment on the same task.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:00:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.13022</guid></item><item><title>Xiaomi-Robotics-0: An Open-Sourced Vision-Language-Action Model with Real-Time Execution</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12684</link><description>A vision-language-action model for robotics combines large-scale pretraining with specialized training techniques to enable real-time execution and high-performance manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Xiaomi-Robotics-0, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model optimized for high performance and fast and smooth real-time execution. The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

While recent LLM-driven code evolution frameworks shift fixed search space target to open-ended program spaces, they primarily rely on scalar metrics (e.g., NDCG, Hit Ratio) that fail to provide qualitative insights into model failures or directional guidance for improvement. To address this, we propose Self-EvolveRec, a novel framework that establishes a directional feedback loop by integrating a User Simulator for qualitative critiques and a Model Diagnosis Tool for quantitative internal verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Diagnosis Tool - Model Co-Evolution strategy to ensure that evaluation criteria dynamically adapt as the recommendation architecture evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Self-EvolveRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NAS and LLM-driven code evolution baselines in both recommendation performance and user satisfaction.

AI-generated summary 				 Identifying vulnerability-fixing commits corresponding to disclosed CVEs is essential for secure software maintenance but remains challenging at scale, as large repositories contain millions of commits of which only a small fraction address security issues. Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 13:37:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12500</guid></item><item><title>TADA! Tuning Audio Diffusion Models through Activation Steering</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11910</link><description>Research reveals that specific attention layers in audio diffusion models control distinct musical concepts, enabling precise manipulation of audio features through activation steering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio diffusion models can synthesize high-fidelity music from text, yet their internal mechanisms for representing high-level concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we use activation patching to demonstrate that distinct semantic musical concepts, such as the presence of specific instruments, vocals, or genre characteristics, are controlled by a small, shared subset of attention layers in state-of-the-art audio diffusion architectures. Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:11:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11910</guid></item><item><title>Light4D: Training-Free Extreme Viewpoint 4D Video Relighting</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.11769</link><description>Light4D enables consistent 4D video synthesis under target illumination through disentangled flow guidance and temporal consistent attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

AI-generated summary 				 Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space.

AI-generated summary 				 We propose UniDFlow, a unified discrete flow-matching framework for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing. It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 16:02:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.12221</guid></item></channel></rss>
