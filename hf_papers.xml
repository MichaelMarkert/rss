  Lightweight Vocabulary Adaptation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19693</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general purpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19693</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Data Scaling Trends and Effects in Reinforcement Learning from
  Human Feedback</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22230</link><description>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 02:29:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22230</guid></item><item><title>Think Before Recommend: Unleashing the Latent Reasoning Power for
  Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22675</link><description>Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing sequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role in many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches predominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final hidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We argue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth, struggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a nuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose ReaRec, the first inference-time computing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user representations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec autoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential recommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to decouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space. Moreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods, Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to further effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec. Remarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the performance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by approximately 30\%-50\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and promising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential recommendation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 01:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22675</guid></item><item><title>A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Models: Language,
  Multimodality, and Beyond</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21614</link><description>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, have demonstrated strong performance gains by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during inference. However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:19:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21614</guid></item><item><title>ReFeed: Multi-dimensional Summarization Refinement with Reflective
  Reasoning on Feedback</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21332</link><description>Summarization refinement faces challenges when extending to multi-dimension. In this paper, we introduce ReFeed, a powerful summarization refinement pipeline that enhances multiple dimensions through reflective reasoning on feedback. To achieve this, we release SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale Long-CoT-based dataset optimized for training a lightweight model with reflective reasoning. Our experiments reveal how the number of dimensions, feedback exposure, and reasoning policy influence refinement performance, highlighting reflective reasoning and simultaneously addressing multiple feedback is crucial to mitigate trade-off between dimensions. Furthermore, ReFeed is robust to noisy feedback and feedback order. Lastly, our finding emphasizes that creating data with a proper goal and guideline constitutes a fundamental pillar of effective reasoning. The dataset and model will be released.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 04:26:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21332</guid></item><item><title>OThink-MR1: Stimulating multimodal generalized reasoning capabilities
  via dynamic reinforcement learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16081</link><description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant traction for their ability to process diverse input data types and generate coherent, contextually relevant outputs across various applications. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Although reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise in overcoming these limitations, it encounters two significant challenges: (1) its generalized capacities in multimodal tasks remain largely unexplored, and (2) its training constraints, including the constant Kullback-Leibler divergence or the clamp strategy, often result in suboptimal bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose OThink-MR1, an advanced MLLM equipped with profound comprehension and reasoning capabilities across multimodal tasks. Specifically, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D), which markedly enhances reinforcement learning (RL) performance. For Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, GRPO-D achieves a relative improvement of more than 5.72% over SFT and more than 13.59% over GRPO in same-task evaluation on two adapted datasets. Furthermore, GRPO-D demonstrates remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, with an average relative improvement of more than 61.63% over SFT in cross-task evaluation. These results highlight that the MLLM trained with GRPO-D on one multimodal task can be effectively transferred to another task, underscoring the superior generalized reasoning capabilities of our proposed OThink-MR1 model.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:21:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16081</guid></item><item><title>ORIGEN: Zero-Shot 3D Orientation Grounding in Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22194</link><description>We introduce ORIGEN, the first zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation across multiple objects and diverse categories. While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 01:27:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22194</guid></item><item><title>Free4D: Tuning-free 4D Scene Generation with Spatial-Temporal
  Consistency</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20785</link><description>We present Free4D, a novel tuning-free framework for 4D scene generation from a single image. Existing methods either focus on object-level generation, making scene-level generation infeasible, or rely on large-scale multi-view video datasets for expensive training, with limited generalization ability due to the scarcity of 4D scene data. In contrast, our key insight is to distill pre-trained foundation models for consistent 4D scene representation, which offers promising advantages such as efficiency and generalizability. 1) To achieve this, we first animate the input image using image-to-video diffusion models followed by 4D geometric structure initialization. 2) To turn this coarse structure into spatial-temporal consistent multiview videos, we design an adaptive guidance mechanism with a point-guided denoising strategy for spatial consistency and a novel latent replacement strategy for temporal coherence. 3) To lift these generated observations into consistent 4D representation, we propose a modulation-based refinement to mitigate inconsistencies while fully leveraging the generated information. The resulting 4D representation enables real-time, controllable rendering, marking a significant advancement in single-image-based 4D scene generation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:30:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20785</guid></item><item><title>Perceptually Accurate 3D Talking Head Generation: New Definitions,
  Speech-Mesh Representation, and Evaluation Metrics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20308</link><description>Recent advancements in speech-driven 3D talking head generation have made significant progress in lip synchronization. However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness -- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with our perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually accurate lip synchronization.

  Problem Solving</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21821</link><description>We introduce PHYSICS, a comprehensive benchmark for university-level physics problem solving. It contains 1297 expert-annotated problems covering six core areas: classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, and optics. Each problem requires advanced physics knowledge and mathematical reasoning. We develop a robust automated evaluation system for precise and reliable validation. Our evaluation of leading foundation models reveals substantial limitations. Even the most advanced model, o3-mini, achieves only 59.9% accuracy, highlighting significant challenges in solving high-level scientific problems. Through comprehensive error analysis, exploration of diverse prompting strategies, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based knowledge augmentation, we identify key areas for improvement, laying the foundation for future advancements.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 02:37:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21821</guid></item><item><title>Segment Any Motion in Videos</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22268</link><description>Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for achieving a high-level understanding of visual scenes and has numerous downstream applications. Humans can effortlessly segment moving objects in videos. Previous work has largely relied on optical flow to provide motion cues; however, this approach often results in imperfect predictions due to challenges such as partial motion, complex deformations, motion blur and background distractions. We propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation that combines long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features and leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification through an iterative prompting strategy. Our model employs Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Attention and Motion-Semantic Decoupled Embedding to prioritize motion while integrating semantic support. Extensive testing on diverse datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, excelling in challenging scenarios and fine-grained segmentation of multiple objects.

  Bridging</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22236</link><description>With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing methods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing fine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent ambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal bridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal estimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise injection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp estimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation fidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality dataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work provides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images by leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 02:30:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22236</guid></item><item><title>Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19108</link><description>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown remarkable performance and scalability across various computer vision tasks. To apply single-scale ViTs to image segmentation, existing methods adopt a convolutional adapter to generate multi-scale features, a pixel decoder to fuse these features, and a Transformer decoder that uses the fused features to make predictions. In this paper, we show that the inductive biases introduced by these task-specific components can instead be learned by the ViT itself, given sufficiently large models and extensive pre-training. Based on these findings, we introduce the Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT), which repurposes the plain ViT architecture to conduct image segmentation. With large-scale models and pre-training, EoMT obtains a segmentation accuracy similar to state-of-the-art models that use task-specific components. At the same time, EoMT is significantly faster than these methods due to its architectural simplicity, e.g., up to 4x faster with ViT-L. Across a range of model sizes, EoMT demonstrates an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and prediction speed, suggesting that compute resources are better spent on scaling the ViT itself rather than adding architectural complexity.

However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated.

  Understanding</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17827</link><description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image/video understanding capabilities. However, there are no publicly standardized benchmarks to assess the abilities of MLLMs in understanding the 4D objects (3D objects with temporal evolution over time). In this paper, we introduce 4D-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in 4D object understanding, featuring tasks in 4D object Question Answering (4D object QA) and 4D object captioning. 4D-Bench provides 4D objects with diverse categories, high-quality annotations, and tasks necessitating multi-view spatial-temporal understanding, different from existing 2D image/video-based benchmarks. With 4D-Bench, we evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source MLLMs. The results from the 4D object captioning experiment indicate that MLLMs generally exhibit weaker temporal understanding compared to their appearance understanding, notably, while open-source models approach closed-source performance in appearance understanding, they show larger performance gaps in temporal understanding. 4D object QA yields surprising findings: even with simple single-object videos, MLLMs perform poorly, with state-of-the-art GPT-4o achieving only 63\% accuracy compared to the human baseline of 91\%. These findings highlight a substantial gap in 4D object understanding and the need for further advancements in MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:49:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17827</guid></item><item><title>Reconstructing Humans with a Biomechanically Accurate Skeleton</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21751</link><description>In this paper, we introduce a method for reconstructing 3D humans from a single image using a biomechanically accurate skeleton model. To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.

Existing implicit field methods often require costly and detail-degrading watertight conversion, while other approaches struggle with high resolutions. This paper introduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that enables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to 1024^3 directly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes with a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions and efficiently handling open surfaces. Crucially, we introduce a frustum-aware sectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during rendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling high-resolution training. This also allows, for the first time, the reconstruction of mesh interiors using only rendering supervision. Building upon this, we demonstrate a complete shape modeling pipeline by training a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a rectified flow transformer for high-quality 3D shape generation. Our experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, with a ~82% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a ~88% increase in F-score compared to previous methods, and demonstrate the generation of high-resolution, detailed 3D shapes with arbitrary topology. By enabling high-resolution, differentiable mesh reconstruction and generation with rendering losses, SparseFlex significantly advances the state-of-the-art in 3D shape representation and modeling.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 02:52:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21732</guid></item><item><title>MedAgent-Pro: Towards Multi-modal Evidence-based Medical Diagnosis via
  Reasoning Agentic Workflow</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18968</link><description>Developing reliable AI systems to assist human clinicians in multi-modal medical diagnosis has long been a key objective for researchers. Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention and achieved success across various domains. With strong reasoning capabilities and the ability to perform diverse tasks based on user instructions, they hold great potential for enhancing medical diagnosis. However, directly applying MLLMs to the medical domain still presents challenges. They lack detailed perception of visual inputs, limiting their ability to perform quantitative image analysis, which is crucial for medical diagnostics. Additionally, MLLMs often exhibit hallucinations and inconsistencies in reasoning, whereas clinical diagnoses must adhere strictly to established criteria. To address these challenges, we propose MedAgent-Pro, an evidence-based reasoning agentic system designed to achieve reliable, explainable, and precise medical diagnoses. This is accomplished through a hierarchical workflow: at the task level, knowledge-based reasoning generate reliable diagnostic plans for specific diseases following retrieved clinical criteria. While at the case level, multiple tool agents process multi-modal inputs, analyze different indicators according to the plan, and provide a final diagnosis based on both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Comprehensive experiments on both 2D and 3D medical diagnosis tasks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of MedAgent-Pro, while case studies further highlight its reliability and interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 03:43:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18968</guid></item><item><title>On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21851</link><description>Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic categories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:43:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21851</guid></item><item><title>X^{2}-Gaussian: 4D Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Continuous-time
  Tomographic Reconstruction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21779</link><description>Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) reconstruction is crucial for capturing dynamic anatomical changes but faces inherent limitations from conventional phase-binning workflows. Current methods discretize temporal resolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing motion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We propose X^2-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT reconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with self-supervised respiratory motion learning. Our approach models anatomical dynamics through a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture that predicts time-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. To remove dependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven periodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles directly from projections via differentiable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR gain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian splatting techniques. By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free period learning, X^2-Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for dynamic clinical imaging.

This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:02:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21544</guid></item></channel></rss>
