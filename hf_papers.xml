AI-generated summary 				 Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 04:46:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15675</guid></item><item><title>GenRecal: Generation after Recalibration from Large to Small
  Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15681</link><description>GenRecal, a novel distillation framework, improves performance of vision-language models by aligning feature representations across different architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 02:06:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15681</guid></item><item><title>Embodied Web Agents: Bridging Physical-Digital Realms for Integrated
  Agent Intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15677</link><description>Embodied Web Agents integrate physical interaction and web-scale reasoning to assess cross-domain intelligence in a novel benchmark environment.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

  Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15068</link><description>PrefBERT, a scoring model, improves open-ended long-form generation by providing better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

  Verification</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15569</link><description>A benchmark named SciVer evaluates multimodal foundation models' claim verification capabilities within scientific contexts, revealing performance gaps and limitations in current models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over 1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 02:58:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15569</guid></item><item><title>CoMemo: LVLMs Need Image Context with Image Memory</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.06279</link><description>CoMemo addresses visual information neglect and spatial awareness in multimodal processing by using a dual-path architecture and a novel positional encoding mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

AI-generated summary 				 Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 05:13:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15050</guid></item><item><title>SwarmAgentic: Towards Fully Automated Agentic System Generation via
  Swarm Intelligence</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15672</link><description>SwarmAgentic is a framework for automated agentic system generation that optimize agent functionality and collaboration through language-driven exploration, outperforming existing baselines in unconstrained tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 07:56:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.15672</guid></item><item><title>MoTE: Mixture of Ternary Experts for Memory-efficient Large Multimodal
  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.14435</link><description>MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient method, improves Mixture-of-Experts models using low-precision ternary experts, enhancing performance and reducing memory footprint for deployment on edge devices.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) effectively scale the model size to boost performance while maintaining fixed active parameters. However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling. Despite they show superior performance on end tasks, the large amount of experts introduces higher memory footprint, which poses significant challenges for the deployment on edge devices. In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower. Given the same amount of expert memory footprint of 3.4GB and combined with post-training quantization, MoTE outperforms MoE-LLaVA by a gain of 4.3% average accuracy on end tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for memory-constrained devices.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 02:52:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.14435</guid></item><item><title>FedNano: Toward Lightweight Federated Tuning for Pretrained Multimodal
  Large Language Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.14824</link><description>FedNano is a federated learning framework that centralizes large language models on servers and uses NanoEdge modules for client-specific adaptation, addressing scalability and privacy issues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:01:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.14824</guid></item></channel></rss>
