  Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18927</link><description>BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO) addresses challenges in off-policy reinforcement learning by dynamically adjusting clipping bounds to improve sample efficiency, stability, and performance in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 03:37:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18927</guid></item><item><title>Every Attention Matters: An Efficient Hybrid Architecture for
  Long-Context Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19338</link><description>The Ring-linear model series, including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0, uses a hybrid architecture combining linear and softmax attention to reduce inference costs and improve training efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 02:05:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19338</guid></item><item><title>LoongRL:Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Reasoning over Long Contexts</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19363</link><description>LoongRL, a data-driven reinforcement learning method, enhances long-context reasoning by transforming short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty tasks, improving accuracy and generalization in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha" moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs. On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5) and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all 128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 01:48:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19363</guid></item><item><title>DaMo: Data Mixing Optimizer in Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs for Mobile
  Phone Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19336</link><description>DaMo, a trainable network optimizing data mixtures for Multimodal Large Language Models, enhances performance across various mobile phone tasks and benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures.

AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 02:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19307</guid></item><item><title>Pico-Banana-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Text-Guided Image Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19808</link><description>Pico-Banana-400K is a large-scale, high-quality dataset for instruction-based image editing, featuring diverse edit pairs, multi-turn editing, preference subsets, and long-short instruction pairs, enabling comprehensive research and benchmarking.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 01:46:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19808</guid></item><item><title>ColorAgent: Building A Robust, Personalized, and Interactive OS Agent</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19386</link><description>ColorAgent, an OS agent using step-wise reinforcement learning and a multi-agent framework, achieves high success rates in long-horizon interactions and personalized user engagement on Android benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

AI-generated summary 				 Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 01:35:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19286</guid></item><item><title>Are they lovers or friends? Evaluating LLMs' Social Reasoning in English
  and Korean Dialogues</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19028</link><description>Current large language models exhibit significant limitations in social reasoning, particularly in inferring interpersonal relationships across different languages, and thinking models or chain-of-thought prompting offer minimal improvement.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean, sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends, sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S. Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around 75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to 58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:22:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19028</guid></item><item><title>olmOCR 2: Unit Test Rewards for Document OCR</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19817</link><description>olmOCR 2, a vision language model trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards, achieves state-of-the-art performance in OCR tasks, particularly in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our model, data and code under permissive open licenses.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 01:44:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19817</guid></item><item><title>MINED: Probing and Updating with Multimodal Time-Sensitive Knowledge for
  Large Multimodal Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19457</link><description>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 02:06:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19457</guid></item><item><title>GigaBrain-0: A World Model-Powered Vision-Language-Action Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19430</link><description>GigaBrain-0, a VLA foundation model, uses world model-generated data to enhance cross-task generalization and policy robustness, improving real-world performance on complex manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:41:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19430</guid></item><item><title>KORE: Enhancing Knowledge Injection for Large Multimodal Models via
  Knowledge-Oriented Augmentations and Constraints</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19316</link><description>KORE is a method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge, using structured augmentations and covariance matrix constraints to minimize catastrophic forgetting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention (preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 02:04:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19316</guid></item><item><title>OmniNWM: Omniscient Driving Navigation World Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18313</link><description>OmniNWM is a unified world model for autonomous driving that generates panoramic videos, encodes actions using Plucker ray-maps, and defines dense rewards based on 3D occupancy, achieving top performance in video generation, control, and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

AI-generated summary 				 Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 02:20:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.16844</guid></item><item><title>VideoAgentTrek: Computer Use Pretraining from Unlabeled Videos</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19488</link><description>VideoAgentTrek automatically extracts GUI interaction data from YouTube videos using Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module, improving task success rates and step accuracy for computer-use agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 01:53:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19488</guid></item><item><title>NeuroAda: Activating Each Neuron's Potential for Parameter-Efficient
  Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18940</link><description>NeuroAda is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines selective adaptation with bypass connections to achieve high performance with minimal trainable parameters and reduced memory usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as leq 0.02% trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

  Experience Library</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18428</link><description>AlphaOPT is a self-improving library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations and solver feedback, improving optimization modeling across industries without costly retraining.  					AI-generated summary 				 Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

AI-generated summary 				 High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:41:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18909</guid></item><item><title>When Do Transformers Learn Heuristics for Graph Connectivity?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19753</link><description>Transformers struggle with generalizable algorithms, preferring heuristics; a disentangled Transformer can learn graph algorithms within its capacity but resorts to heuristics otherwise.  					AI-generated summary 				 Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an L-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly 3^L, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter leq 3^L) drive the learning of a correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the degree-based heuristic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:51:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19753</guid></item><item><title>Machine Text Detectors are Membership Inference Attacks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19492</link><description>Theoretical and empirical investigation shows strong transferability between membership inference attacks and machine-generated text detection, highlighting the need for cross-task collaboration and introducing MINT for unified evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho &gt; 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:15:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.19492</guid></item><item><title>ProfBench: Multi-Domain Rubrics requiring Professional Knowledge to
  Answer and Judge</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18941</link><description>ProfBench evaluates large language models in professional domains using human-expert criteria, revealing challenges and performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000 response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3 orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community. Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex, professional-domain tasks.

AI-generated summary 				 Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 03:02:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.18917</guid></item></channel></rss>
