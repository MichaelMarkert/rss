AI-generated summary 				 Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.01554</guid></item><item><title>InfiniDepth: Arbitrary-Resolution and Fine-Grained Depth Estimation with Neural Implicit Fields</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03252</link><description>InfiniDepth represents depth as neural implicit fields using a local implicit decoder, enabling continuous 2D coordinate querying for arbitrary-resolution depth estimation and superior performance in fine-detail regions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:56:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03252</guid></item><item><title>CogFlow: Bridging Perception and Reasoning through Knowledge Internalization for Visual Mathematical Problem Solving</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.01874</link><description>Visual mathematical problem solving remains challenging for multimodal large language models, prompting the development of CogFlow, a cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that enhances perception, internalization, and reasoning through synergistic rewards and visual-gated policy optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perceptionRightarrowinternalizationRightarrowreasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:36:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.01874</guid></item><item><title>LTX-2: Efficient Joint Audio-Visual Foundation Model</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03233</link><description>LTX-2 is an open-source audiovisual diffusion model that generates synchronized video and audio content using a dual-stream transformer architecture with cross-modal attention and classifier-free guidance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:42:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03233</guid></item><item><title>UniCorn: Towards Self-Improving Unified Multimodal Models through Self-Generated Supervision</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03193</link><description>UniCorn, a self-improvement framework for unified multimodal models, addresses generation gaps through self-play and cognitive pattern reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:01:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03193</guid></item><item><title>NitroGen: An Open Foundation Model for Generalist Gaming Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02427</link><description>NitroGen is a vision-action foundation model trained on extensive gameplay data that demonstrates strong cross-game generalization and effective transfer learning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model for generalist gaming agents that is trained on 40,000 hours of gameplay videos across more than 1,000 games. We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:08:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02427</guid></item><item><title>DreamStyle: A Unified Framework for Video Stylization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02785</link><description>DreamStyle is a unified video stylization framework that supports multiple style conditions while addressing style inconsistency and temporal flicker through a specialized data curation pipeline and LoRA training approach.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:18:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02785</guid></item><item><title>MiMo-V2-Flash Technical Report</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02780</link><description></description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:29:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02780</guid></item><item><title>X-MuTeST: A Multilingual Benchmark for Explainable Hate Speech Detection and A Novel LLM-consulted Explanation Framework</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03194</link><description>A novel explainability-guided training framework for hate speech detection in Indic languages that combines large language models with attention-enhancing techniques and provides human-annotated rationales for improved performance and interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples.

AI-generated summary 				 Capturing complex user preferences from sparse behavioral sequences remains a fundamental challenge in sequential recommendation. Recent latent reasoning methods have shown promise by extending test-time computation through multi-step reasoning, yet they exclusively rely on depth-level scaling along a single trajectory, suffering from diminishing returns as reasoning depth increases. To address this limitation, we propose Parallel Latent Reasoning (PLR), a novel framework that pioneers width-level computational scaling by exploring multiple diverse reasoning trajectories simultaneously. PLR constructs parallel reasoning streams through learnable trigger tokens in continuous latent space, preserves diversity across streams via global reasoning regularization, and adaptively synthesizes multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams aggregation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining real-time inference efficiency. Theoretical analysis further validates the effectiveness of parallel reasoning in improving generalization capability. Our work opens new avenues for enhancing reasoning capacity in sequential recommendation beyond existing depth scaling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:38:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03153</guid></item><item><title>WebGym: Scaling Training Environments for Visual Web Agents with Realistic Tasks</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02439</link><description>WebGym presents a large-scale open-source environment for training visual web agents using reinforcement learning with high-throughput asynchronous sampling, achieving superior performance on unseen websites compared to proprietary models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:26:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.02439</guid></item><item><title>FFP-300K: Scaling First-Frame Propagation for Generalizable Video Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.01720</link><description>A new large-scale video dataset and framework are presented that enable effective first-frame propagation without runtime guidance through adaptive spatio-temporal positional encoding and self-distillation techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift. Comprehensive experiments on the EditVerseBench benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforming existing academic and commercial models by receiving about 0.2 PickScore and 0.3 VLM score improvement against these competitors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:43:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.01720</guid></item></channel></rss>
