AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

AI-generated summary 				 Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:07:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00446</guid></item><item><title>Interactive Training: Feedback-Driven Neural Network Optimization</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02297</link><description>Interactive Training is a framework that allows real-time, feedback-driven intervention during neural network training, improving stability and adaptability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time, feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process, allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data, and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs, paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training dynamics.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:44:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02297</guid></item><item><title>StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world
  Markets?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02209</link><description>StockBench evaluates large language models in realistic stock trading environments, revealing challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:08:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02209</guid></item><item><title>VOGUE: Guiding Exploration with Visual Uncertainty Improves Multimodal
  Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01444</link><description>VOGUE, a method that shifts exploration to the visual input space by quantifying policy sensitivity to visual perturbations, enhances multimodal reasoning in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration), a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:03:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01444</guid></item><item><title>CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State

  Illusions</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02314</link><description>A novel density-guided poisoning method for 3D Gaussian Splatting enhances attack effectiveness by strategically injecting Gaussian points and disrupting multi-view consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

  Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02253</link><description>DragFlow leverages FLUX's strong generative priors and region-based editing with affine transformations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in drag-based image editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:52:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02253</guid></item><item><title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Agents for Computer Use</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02250</link><description>Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) improves the reliability and success rates of computer-use agents by generating and selecting among multiple rollouts using behavior narratives, achieving state-of-the-art performance on OSWorld and strong generalization to different operating systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:30:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02250</guid></item><item><title>RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01265</link><description>RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, enhances reasoning models by integrating exploration into pretraining, leading to significant performance improvements across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:25:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01265</guid></item><item><title>TOUCAN: Synthesizing 1.5M Tool-Agentic Data from Real-World MCP
  Environments</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01179</link><description>Toucan, a large publicly available tool-agentic dataset, enhances the performance of LLM agents by providing diverse, realistic, and complex multi-tool and multi-turn interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:55:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01179</guid></item><item><title>Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01284</link><description>Ovi is a unified audio-video generation model using twin-DiT modules with blockwise cross-modal fusion, enabling natural synchronization and high-quality multimodal outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips.

  Context</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00428</link><description>Incorporating clinical context into automated structured radiology report generation improves report quality by addressing temporal hallucinations and utilizing comprehensive patient data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at https://github.com/vuno/contextualized-srrg.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:10:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00428</guid></item><item><title>F2LLM Technical Report: Matching SOTA Embedding Performance with 6

AI-generated summary 				 We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research in the field, we release the models, training dataset, and code, positioning F2LLM as a strong, reproducible, and budget-friendly baseline for future works.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:03:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02294</guid></item><item><title>Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.26376</link><description>ScalingAR enhances next-token prediction in autoregressive image generation by using token entropy and adaptive scaling, improving model performance and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP) autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:00:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.26376</guid></item><item><title>Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02259</link><description>Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates can achieve competitive performance in molecular energy and force prediction without predefined graphs, demonstrating adaptability and scalability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinatesx2013without predefined graphs or physical priorsx2013can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patternsx2013such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distancex2013and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:44:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02259</guid></item><item><title>RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via
  Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02240</link><description>RewardMap, a multi-stage reinforcement learning framework, enhances multimodal large language models' visual understanding and reasoning skills through dense reward signals and a difficulty-aware reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:58:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02240</guid></item><item><title>A Rigorous Benchmark with Multidimensional Evaluation for Deep Research
  Agents: From Answers to Reports</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02190</link><description>A benchmark and evaluation framework for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) assesses their performance on complex tasks with multidimensional metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents (DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively. This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises 214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:15:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02190</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject
  Fidelity</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02315</link><description>A theoretical framework and algorithms for improving multi-subject fidelity in text-to-image models through control over sampling dynamics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:55:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02315</guid></item><item><title>Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and

AI-generated summary 				 Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 times 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:52:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00523</guid></item><item><title>Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm:
  Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.24203</link><description>Off-policy reinforcement learning for large language models is explored through a new derivation of group-relative REINFORCE, offering insights into importance sampling, clipping, and data-weighting strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:38:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.24203</guid></item><item><title>SKYLENAGE Technical Report: Mathematical Reasoning and

AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites, yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a 100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length, numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%; accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH; together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:06:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01241</guid></item><item><title>Parallel Scaling Law: Unveiling Reasoning Generalization through A
  Cross-Linguistic Perspective</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02272</link><description>Research investigates cross-linguistic transferability of reasoning capabilities in Large Reasoning Models, revealing significant variations and proposing a parallel training approach to improve generalization across languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question: Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively transfer to other languages? We address this by systematically evaluating English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization. To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental results yield three key findings: First-Parallel Leap, a substantial leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single parallel language, and a predictable Parallel Scaling Law, revealing that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as Monolingual Generalization Gap, indicating that English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the development of more language-agnostic LRMs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:57:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02272</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking the shape convention of an MLP</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01796</link><description>Hourglass MLP blocks, with skip connections in expanded dimensions and narrow bottlenecks, outperform conventional narrow-wide-narrow MLPs in generative tasks across image datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search. Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase, optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers and other residual networks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:58:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01796</guid></item><item><title>MedQ-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring Medical Image Quality Assessment
  Abilities in MLLMs</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01691</link><description>MedQ-Bench introduces a benchmark for language-based evaluation of medical image quality using Multi-modal Large Language Models, focusing on both perceptual and reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:57:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01691</guid></item><item><title>Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01670</link><description>Computer-Use Agents consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness, a bias that leads to risky behavior regardless of feasibility or context, as demonstrated by the BLIND-ACT benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:11:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01670</guid></item><item><title>TimeSeriesScientist: A General-Purpose AI Agent for Time Series Analysis</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01538</link><description>TimeSeriesScientist (TSci) is an LLM-driven framework that automates time series forecasting with minimal human intervention, outperforming statistical and LLM-based methods and providing transparent reports.  					AI-generated summary 				 Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:29:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01538</guid></item><item><title>FrameThinker: Learning to Think with Long Videos via Multi-Turn Frame
  Spotlighting</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.24304</link><description>FrameThinker, a novel framework, enhances video reasoning by iteratively interrogating video content through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving significant improvements and efficiency over existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy. Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 02:13:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.24304</guid></item><item><title>ExGRPO: Learning to Reason from Experience</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02245</link><description>ExGRPO, a framework that prioritizes valuable reasoning experiences, improves and stabilizes reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards for large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:01:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.02245</guid></item><item><title>VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.01623</link><description>VLA-R1 enhances VLA models with RLVR and GRPO to improve reasoning and execution, achieving better generalization and real-world performance using a new dataset with chain-of-thought supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

  Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00537</link><description>Research on large language models reveals an asymmetric spectral scaling law in feed-forward networks, indicating that increasing width primarily adds low-energy directions while dominant modes saturate early, leading to underutilized latent space.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 03:34:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00537</guid></item><item><title>AReUReDi: Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows with

AI-generated summary 				 Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 01:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.00352</guid></item></channel></rss>
