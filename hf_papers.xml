  Interaction and Voice Role-Play</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02707</link><description>A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 05:06:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02707</guid></item><item><title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02387</link><description>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 04:02:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02387</guid></item><item><title>FormalMATH: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language
  Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02735</link><description>Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:30:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02735</guid></item><item><title>R1-Reward: Training Multimodal Reward Model Through Stable Reinforcement
  Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02835</link><description>Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a 8.4% improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a 14.3% improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:39:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02835</guid></item><item><title>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization
  in Rejection Sampling and RL</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02391</link><description>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 06:04:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02391</guid></item><item><title>Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02222</link><description>We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:00:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02222</guid></item><item><title>Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop
  Reasoning with Transformers</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20752</link><description>Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio phi_r of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing phi_r drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 05:08:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20752</guid></item><item><title>SkillMimic-V2: Learning Robust and Generalizable Interaction Skills from
  Sparse and Noisy Demonstrations</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02094</link><description>We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations, there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 04:41:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02094</guid></item><item><title>ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Layer Pruning and Linear
  Transformations</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02819</link><description>We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 08:33:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02819</guid></item><item><title>Think on your Feet: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for
  Social Agents</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02156</link><description>Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Mode Learning (AML) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction rightarrow deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the Adaptive Mode Policy Optimization (AMPO) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:37:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02156</guid></item><item><title>Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration for LLMs via Reinforcement
  Learning</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01441</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and generalizable problem-solving in LLMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 04:13:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01441</guid></item><item><title>SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based
  Image Editing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02370</link><description>Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 03:04:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02370</guid></item><item><title>Low-Precision Training of Large Language Models: Methods, Challenges,
  and Opportunities</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01043</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several componentsx2013such as weights, activations, and gradientsx2013each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field. A collection of papers discussed in this survey is provided in https://github.com/Hao840/Awesome-Low-Precision-Training.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:06:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01043</guid></item><item><title>Ming-Lite-Uni: Advancements in Unified Architecture for Natural
  Multimodal Interaction</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02471</link><description>We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further refined.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:30:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02471</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on Inference Engines for Large Language Models: Perspectives on
  Optimization and Efficiency</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01658</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 04:51:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01658</guid></item><item><title>TEMPURA: Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for
  Reasoning in Action</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01583</link><description>Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 03:26:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01583</guid></item><item><title>MUSAR: Exploring Multi-Subject Customization from Single-Subject Dataset
  via Attention Routing</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02823</link><description>Current multi-subject customization approaches encounter two critical challenges: the difficulty in acquiring diverse multi-subject training data, and attribute entanglement across different subjects. To bridge these gaps, we propose MUSAR - a simple yet effective framework to achieve robust multi-subject customization while requiring only single-subject training data. Firstly, to break the data limitation, we introduce debiased diptych learning. It constructs diptych training pairs from single-subject images to facilitate multi-subject learning, while actively correcting the distribution bias introduced by diptych construction via static attention routing and dual-branch LoRA. Secondly, to eliminate cross-subject entanglement, we introduce dynamic attention routing mechanism, which adaptively establishes bijective mappings between generated images and conditional subjects. This design not only achieves decoupling of multi-subject representations but also maintains scalable generalization performance with increasing reference subjects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MUSAR outperforms existing methods - even those trained on multi-subject dataset - in image quality, subject consistency, and interaction naturalness, despite requiring only single-subject dataset.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 04:00:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02823</guid></item><item><title>LLaMA-Omni2: LLM-based Real-time Spoken Chatbot with Autoregressive

Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 02:37:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02625</guid></item><item><title>Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and
  Attack-Defense Evaluation</title><link>https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01456</link><description>LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning) necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs. While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally, larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing unlearning in MLLMs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 08:25:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01456</guid></item></channel></rss>
