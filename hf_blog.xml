Published April 4, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 18 +12 abidlabs Abubakar Abid 5 years ago, we launched Gradio as a simple Python library to let researchers at Stanford easily demo computer vision models with a web interface. Today, Gradio is used by &gt;1 million developers each month to build and share AI web apps. This includes some of the most popular open-source projects of all time, like Automatic1111 , Oobabooga’s Text Generation WebUI , Dall-E Mini , and LLaMA-Factory . How did we get here? How did Gradio keep growing in the very crowded field of open-source Python libraries? I get this question a lot from folks who are building their own open-source libraries. This post distills some of the lessons that I have learned over the past few years: Invest in good primitives, not high-level abstractions Embed virality directly into your library Focus on a (growing) niche Your only roadmap should be rapid iteration Maximize ways users...</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-1m</guid></item><item><title>The NLP Course is becoming the LLM Course!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/llm-course</link><description>Back to Articles The NLP Course is becoming the LLM Course!

With over 4 million builders deploying models on the Hub, the rapid growth of the platform necessitated a rethinking of how sensitive configuration data —secrets— are managed. Last year, the engineering teams set out to improve the handling of their secrets and credentials. After evaluating tools like HashiCorp Vault, they ultimately chose Infisical . This case study details their migration to Infisical, explains how they integrated its powerful features, and highlights how it enabled engineers to work more efficiently and securely.
