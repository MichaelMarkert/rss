This represented a significant milestone, but it was just the beginning. In 6 months, 500,000 repositories holding 20 PB joined the move to Xet as the Hub outgrows Git LFS and transitions to a storage system that scales with the workloads of AI builders. Today, more than 1 million people on the Hub are using Xet. In May, it became the default on the Hub for new users and organizations . With only a few dozen GitHub issues, forum threads, and Discord messages, this is perhaps the quietest migration of this...</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/migrating-the-hub-to-xet</guid></item><item><title>Asynchronous Robot Inference: Decoupling Action Prediction and Execution</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/async-robot-inference</link><description>Back to Articles Asynchronous Robot Inference: Decoupling Action Prediction and Execution Published July 10, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 31 +25 Francesco Capuano fracapuano Follow Steven Palma imstevenpmwork Follow Michel Aractingi aractingi Follow Mustafa Shukor mshukor Follow Dana Aubakirova danaaubakirova Follow Adil Zouitine AdilZtn Follow Simon Alibert aliberts Follow Table of Contents Getting started Async inference: a deep dive 1.

Using async in your setup Conclusions TL;DR Robotic policies are increasingly bulky, and predict chunks of future actions rather than a single next action. This results in the robot being idle while awaiting new actions to perform, introducing noticeable lags at execution, and lacking responsiveness. Asynchronous inference tightens the control loop, removing lags at runtime and resulting in...</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/async-robot-inference</guid></item><item><title>ScreenEnv: Deploy your full stack Desktop Agent</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/screenenv</link><description>Back to Articles ScreenEnv: Deploy your full stack Desktop Agent Published July 10, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 46 +40 Amir Mahla A-Mahla Follow Aymeric Roucher m-ric Follow What is ScreenEnv?
