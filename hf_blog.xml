TRL users can now discover, install, and run RapidFire AI as the fastest way to compare multiple fine-tuning/post-training configurations to customize LLMs without major code changes and without bloating GPU requirements. Why this matters When fine-tuning or post-training LLMs, teams often do not have the time and/or budget to compare multiple configs even though that can significantly boost eval metrics.

We provide an example Space and accompanying code to start the ball rolling on the idea. Realistic voice generation technology has gotten uncannily good in the past few years. In some situations, it’s possible to generate a synthetic voice that sounds almost exactly like the voice of a real person. And today, what once felt like science fiction is reality: Voice cloning. With just a few seconds of recorded speech, anyone’s voice can be made to say almost anything. Voice generation, and in particular the subtask of voice cloning, has notable risks and benefits.
