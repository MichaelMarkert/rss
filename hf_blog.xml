Gradio‚Äôs gr.Dataframe component is one of our most popular components, we've seen it used in a variety of awesome apps, like leaderboards, dashboards, and interactive visualisations. Although we hadn't made any changes to the dataframe in quite some time, our backlog of issues had been growing, and some improvements had been in demand for a while. Well ‚Äî we‚Äôre now super excited to release a host of new updates to Gradio‚Äôs dataframe component. Over the last 6 weeks, we‚Äôve closed over 70 dataframe issues - including bugs, improvements and enhancements. 1. Multi-Cell Selection You can select multiple cells at once!

Are your Inference Endpoints overloaded? How many requests are they handling? Having well-visualized, relevant metrics displayed in real-time is crucial for monitoring and debugging. We realized that our analytics dashboard needed a refresh. Since we debug a lot of endpoints ourselves, we‚Äôve felt the same pain as our users. That‚Äôs why we sat down to plan and make several improvements to provide a better experience for you. What‚Äôs New? ‚è∞ Real-Time Metrics: Data now updates in real-time, ensuring you get an accurate and up-to-the-second view of your endpoint‚Äôs performance.

If we look at the evaluation on LiveCodeBench below, we can see that the 7B parameter variant outperforms Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o. These models are the daily driver of many engineers in applications like Cursor and VSCode. Evals are great and all, but I want to get my hands dirty and feel the commits!

We have decided to add JFrog's scanner to our platform to continue improving security on the Hugging Face Hub. JFrog's scanner brings new functionality to scanning, aimed at reducing false positives on the Hub. Indeed, what we currently observe is that model weights can contain code that is executed upon deserialization and sometimes at inference time, depending on the format. This code is oftentimes a non harmful practicality for the developer.

This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike. For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called ‚Äútiles‚Äù of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image. Therefore, we want to pilot an idea with the community ‚Äî delegating the decoding process to a remote endpoint.
