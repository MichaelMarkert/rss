A lot has changed since then (MLX and chat templates did not exist!), and we’ve learned how the community is actually using the library. We want to double down on the use cases that provide most benefits to the community, and lay out the foundations for the future. Spoiler alert: after this release, we’ll focus a lot on MLX and agentic use cases 🚀 What is swift-transformers swift-transformers is a Swift library that aims to reduce the friction...</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/swift-transformers</guid></item><item><title>Smol2Operator: Post-Training GUI Agents for Computer Use</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/smol2operator</link><description>Back to Articles Smol2Operator: Post-Training GUI Agents for Computer Use Published September 23, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 96 +90 Amir Mahla A-Mahla Follow merve merve Follow Sergio Paniego sergiopaniego Follow Vaibhav Srivastav reach-vb Follow Lewis Tunstall lewtun Follow Table of Contents Introduction 1.

Developers might find a model that perfectly fits their use case, but have no systematic way to evaluate its security posture, privacy implications, or potential failure modes. As models become more powerful and adoption accelerates, we need equally rapid progress in AI safety and security reporting.

The need for watermarking has become even more critical as people all over the world have begun to generate and share AI-generated images, video, audio, and text. Images and video have become so realistic that they’re nearly impossible to distinguish from what you’d see captured by a real camera. Addressing this issue is multi-faceted, but there is one, clear, low-hanging fruit 🍇: In order for people to know what's real and what's synthetic, use visible watermarks. To help out, we at Hugging Face have made visible watermarking trivially easy: Whenever you create a Space like an app or a demo , you can use our in-house app-building library Gradio to display watermarks with a single command.
