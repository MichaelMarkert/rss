Published October 22, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 47 +41 Tom Aarsen tomaarsen Follow Project History Acknowledgements Getting Started Today, we are announcing that Sentence Transformers is transitioning from Iryna Gurevychâ€™s Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at the TU Darmstadt to Hugging Face. Hugging Face's Tom Aarsen has already been maintaining the library since late 2023 and will continue to lead the project. At its new home, Sentence Transformers will benefit from Hugging Face's robust infrastructure, including continuous integration and testing, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest advancements in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SentenceBERT or SBERT) is a popular open-source library for generating high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning. Since its inception by Nils Reimers in 2019, Sentence Transformers has been widely...</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-joins-hf</guid></item><item><title>Hugging Face and VirusTotal collaborate to strengthen AI security</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/virustotal</link><description>Back to Articles Hugging Face and VirusTotal collaborate to strengthen AI security Published October 22, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 9 +3 Adrien Carreira XciD Follow Bernardo Quintero bquintero Follow guest Why this matters How the collaboration works Benefits for the community Join us Weâ€™re excited to announce a new collaboration between Hugging Face and VirusTotal , the worldâ€™s leading threat-intelligence and malware analysis platform.

In 2025, it is more feasible than ever to run truly competitive models on-device. dots.ocr , a 3B parameter OCR model from RedNote, surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro in OmniDocBench , making OCR a truly no compromises on-device use case. Running models on-device is certainly appealing to developers: no smuggling API keys, zero cost, and no network required. However, if we want these models to run on-device, we need to be mindful of the limited compute and power budgets. Enter the Neural Engine, Apple's custom AI accelerator that has shipped with every Apple device since 2017.

Try It Yourself What's Next? The Problem People are trying to vibe code games. And it kind of works, at first. However, as the project grows, things begin to fall apart. Why? And what can we do about it? I'll talk about the problem, how I fixed it, and where to go from here. What Is "Vibe Coding"? First, what is vibe coding? It's originally coined by Andrej Karpathy in a viral tweet where it's defined as where you "fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget the code even exists". However, since then, it's used descriptively to mean a lot of different things, anywhere from just "using AI when coding" to...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/vibegame</guid></item><item><title>Accelerating Qwen3-8B Agent on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra with Depth-Pruned Draft Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/intel-qwen3-agent</link><description>Back to Articles Accelerating Qwen3-8B Agent on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra with Depth-Pruned Draft Models Published September 29, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 17 +11 Igor Margulis imargulis Follow Intel Ofir Zafrir ofirzaf Follow Intel Shira Guskin sguskin Follow Intel Guy Boudoukh guybd Follow Intel Pedro Cuenca pcuenq Follow Qwen3 Accelerating Qwen3-8B on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra with Speculative Decoding Pushing Performance Further Integration with ðŸ¤—smolagents References TL;DR: Qwen3-8B is one of the most exciting recent releasesâ€”a model with native agentic capabilities, making it a natural fit for the AIPC.
