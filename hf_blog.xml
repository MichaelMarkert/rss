The need for watermarking has become even more critical as people all over the world have begun to generate and share AI-generated images, video, audio, and text. Images and video have become so realistic that they‚Äôre nearly impossible to distinguish from what you‚Äôd see captured by a real camera. Addressing this issue is multi-faceted, but there is one, clear, low-hanging fruit üçá: In order for people to know what's real and what's synthetic, use visible watermarks. To help out, we at Hugging Face have made visible watermarking trivially easy: Whenever you create a Space like an app or a demo , you can use our in-house app-building library Gradio to display watermarks with a single command.

Manual Research 2. Scripted Tools 3. MCP Integration Setup and Usage Quick Setup Learn More Academic research involves frequent research discovery : finding papers, code, related models and datasets. This typically means switching between platforms like arXiv , GitHub , and Hugging Face , manually piecing together connections. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows agentic models to communicate with external tools and data sources. For research discovery, this means AI can use research tools through natural language requests, automating platform switching and cross-referencing.

Published August 12, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 33 +27 Long Phan justinphan3110 Follow cais Cl√©mentine Fourrier clefourrier Follow TextQuests Evaluations Discussion Citations The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled remarkable progress on established academic and industrial benchmarks. Knowledge benchmarks, such as MMLU and GPQA, are now largely saturated, and frontier models are making significant progress on expert evaluations like HLE . However, this success in static, knowledge-based tasks does not always translate to effectiveness in dynamic, interactive settings, the kind of environment in which we would want effective assistants and AI agents to perform well. Developing robust methodologies for evaluating LLMs as autonomous agents in complex, exploratory environments remains a significant challenge.
