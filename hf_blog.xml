We have decided to add JFrog's scanner to our platform to continue improving security on the Hugging Face Hub. JFrog's scanner brings new functionality to scanning, aimed at reducing false positives on the Hub. Indeed, what we currently observe is that model weights can contain code that is executed upon deserialization and sometimes at inference time, depending on the format. This code is oftentimes a non harmful practicality for the developer. As our picklescan scanner only performs pattern matching on module names, we cannot always confirm that usage...</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/jfrog</guid></item><item><title>A Deepdive into Aya Vision: Advancing the Frontier of Multilingual Multimodality</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/aya-vision</link><description>Back to Articles A Deepdive into Aya Vision: Advancing the Frontier of Multilingual Multimodality Published March 4, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 48 +42 saurabhdash Saurabh Dash CohereForAI olivernan Yiyang Nan CohereForAI ArashAhmadian Arash Ahmadian CohereForAI johndang-cohere John Dang CohereForAI Aya Vision Architecture and Training Training process Multimodal Data Enhancement and Expanding Language Coverage Multimodal Model Merging Scaling up to 32B Aya Vision Benchmark ‚Äì a multilingual evaluation data Designed for real-world applications Getting Started with Aya Acknowledgments References With the release of the Aya Vision family , our new 8B and 32B parameter vision-language models (VLMs), we are addressing one of the biggest challenges in AI: bringing multilingual performance to multimodal models .

This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike. For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called ‚Äútiles‚Äù of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image. Therefore, we want to pilot an idea with the community ‚Äî delegating the decoding process to a remote endpoint. No data is stored or tracked, and code is open...</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/remote_vae</guid></item><item><title>SigLIP 2: A better multilingual vision language encoder</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/siglip2</link><description>Back to Articles SigLIP 2: A better multilingual vision language encoder Published February 21, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 124 +118 ariG23498 Aritra Roy Gosthipaty merve Merve Noyan qubvel-hf Pavel Iakubovskii TL;DR Introduction Add a decoder (it‚Äôs that simple) Self-distillation with Global-Local loss and Masked Prediction Adapting to different resolutions Run inference with transformers Zero-shot Classification Encode images for downstream tasks Comparing SigLIP 1 with SigLIP 2 Using the encoder for VLMs Acknowledgements TL;DR Today Google releases a new and better family of multilingual vision-language encoders, SigLIP 2 .
