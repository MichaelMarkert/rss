To name a few milestones: OpenAI and Google released their live multimodal APIs for ChatGPT and Gemini. OpenAI even went so far as to release a 1-800-ChatGPT phone number! Kyutai released Moshi , a fully open-source audio-to-audio LLM. Alibaba released Qwen2-Audio and Fixie.ai released Ultravox - two open-source LLMs that natively understand audio. ElevenLabs raised $180m in their Series C. Despite the explosion on the model and funding side, it's still difficult to build real-time AI applications that stream audio and video, especially in Python.

This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike. For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called ‚Äútiles‚Äù of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image. Therefore, we want to pilot an idea with the community ‚Äî delegating the decoding process to a remote endpoint. No data is stored or tracked, and code is...</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/remote_vae</guid></item><item><title>SigLIP 2: A better multilingual vision language encoder</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/siglip2</link><description>Back to Articles SigLIP 2: A better multilingual vision language encoder Published February 21, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 113 +107 ariG23498 Aritra Roy Gosthipaty merve Merve Noyan qubvel-hf Pavel Iakubovskii TL;DR Introduction Add a decoder (it‚Äôs that simple) Self-distillation with Global-Local loss and Masked Prediction Adapting to different resolutions Run inference with transformers Zero-shot Classification Encode images for downstream tasks Comparing SigLIP 1 with SigLIP 2 Using the encoder for VLMs Acknowledgements TL;DR Today Google releases a new and better family of multilingual vision-language encoders, SigLIP 2 .
