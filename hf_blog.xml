What this means for you, as a model user What this means for you, as a model creator TLDR: Going forward, we're aiming for Transformers to be the pivot across frameworks: if a model architecture is supported by transformers, you can expect it to be supported in the rest of the ecosystem. Transformers was created in 2019, shortly following the release of the BERT Transformer model. Since then, we've continuously aimed to add state-of-the-art architectures, initially focused on NLP, then growing to Audio and computer vision. Today, transformers is the default library for LLMs and VLMs in the Python ecosystem. Transformers now supports 300+ model architectures, with an average...</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/transformers-model-definition</guid></item><item><title>Improving Hugging Face Model Access for Kaggle Users</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/kaggle-integration</link><description>Back to Articles Improving Hugging Face Model Access for Kaggle Users Published May 14, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 17 +11 roseberryv Vincent Roseberry kaggle megrisdal Meg Risdal kaggle julien-c Julien Chaumond pcuenq Pedro Cuenca reach-vb Vaibhav Srivastav How to get started How does this work with private and consent-gated Hugging Face models?
