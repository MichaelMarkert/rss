Its simplicity, flexibility, and expansive model zoo make it a powerful tool for rapid development. But once you're ready to move from notebooks to production, inference performance becomes mission-critical. That‚Äôs where SGLang comes in. Designed for high-throughput, low-latency inference, SGLang now offers seamless integration with transformers as a backend. This means you can pair the flexibility of transformers with the raw performance of SGLang.
