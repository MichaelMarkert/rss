We have decided to add JFrog's scanner to our platform to continue improving security on the Hugging Face Hub. JFrog's scanner brings new functionality to scanning, aimed at reducing false positives on the Hub. Indeed, what we currently observe is that model weights can contain code that is executed upon deserialization and sometimes at inference time, depending on the format. This code is oftentimes a non harmful practicality for the developer.

This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike. For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called ‚Äútiles‚Äù of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image. Therefore, we want to pilot an idea with the community ‚Äî delegating the decoding process to a remote endpoint.
