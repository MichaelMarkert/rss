We provide an example Space and accompanying code to start the ball rolling on the idea. Realistic voice generation technology has gotten uncannily good in the past few years. In some situations, it’s possible to generate a synthetic voice that sounds almost exactly like the voice of a real person. And today, what once felt like science fiction is reality: Voice cloning. With just a few seconds of recorded speech, anyone’s voice can be made to say almost anything. Voice generation, and in particular the subtask of voice cloning, has notable risks and benefits. The risks of “deepfakes”, such as the...</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/voice-consent-gate</guid></item><item><title>Streaming datasets: 100x More Efficient</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/streaming-datasets</link><description>Back to Articles Streaming datasets: 100x More Efficient Published October 27, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 38 +32 Andres Marafioti andito Follow Quentin Lhoest lhoestq Follow ben burtenshaw burtenshaw Follow Pedro Cuenca pcuenq Follow merve merve Follow TLDR Streaming: The Same Easy API The Challenge: Streaming at Scale Under the Hood: What We Improved How are we faster than plain S3: Xet Need a custom streaming pipeline ?
