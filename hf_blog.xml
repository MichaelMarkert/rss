We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a 1.7x improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google C3 VM instances.

These models can analyze images and videos to describe scenes, create captions, and answer questions about visual content. While running AI models on your own device can be difficult as these models are often computationally demanding, it also offers significant benefits: including improved privacy since your data stays on your machine, and...</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino-vlm</guid></item><item><title>SOTA OCR on-device with Core ML and dots.ocr</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/dots-ocr-ne</link><description>Back to Articles SOTA OCR on-device with Core ML and dots.ocr Published October 2, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 43 +37 Christopher Fleetwood FL33TW00D-HF Follow Pedro Cuenca pcuenq Follow Conversion Dots.OCR Step 0: Understand and simplify the model Step 1: A simple harness Step 2: Bug hunting Step 3: Benchmarking Every year our hardware is a little more powerful, our models a little smarter for each parameter. In 2025, it is more feasible than ever to run truly competitive models on-device. dots.ocr , a 3B parameter OCR model from RedNote, surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro in OmniDocBench , making OCR a truly no compromises on-device use case. Running models on-device is certainly appealing to developers: no smuggling API keys, zero cost, and no network required. However, if we want these models to run on-device, we need to be mindful of the limited compute and power budgets. Enter the Neural Engine, Apple's custom AI accelerator that has shipped with every Apple device since 2017.

Existing benchmarks struggle to measure true generalization, while RTEB addresses this with a hybrid strategy of open and private datasets.

Try It Yourself What's Next? The Problem People are trying to vibe code games. And it kind of works, at first. However, as the project grows, things begin to fall apart. Why? And what can we do about it? I'll talk about the problem, how I fixed it, and where to go from here. What Is "Vibe Coding"? First, what is vibe coding? It's originally coined by Andrej Karpathy in a viral tweet where it's defined as where you "fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget the code even exists". However, since then, it's used descriptively to mean a lot of different things, anywhere from just "using AI when coding" to...</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/blog/vibegame</guid></item><item><title>Accelerating Qwen3-8B Agent on Intel® Core™ Ultra with Depth-Pruned Draft Models</title><link>https://huggingface.co/blog/intel-qwen3-agent</link><description>Back to Articles Accelerating Qwen3-8B Agent on Intel® Core™ Ultra with Depth-Pruned Draft Models Published September 29, 2025 Update on GitHub Upvote 17 +11 Igor Margulis imargulis Follow Intel Ofir Zafrir ofirzaf Follow Intel Shira Guskin sguskin Follow Intel Guy Boudoukh guybd Follow Intel Pedro Cuenca pcuenq Follow Qwen3 Accelerating Qwen3-8B on Intel® Core™ Ultra with Speculative Decoding Pushing Performance Further Integration with 🤗smolagents References TL;DR: Qwen3-8B is one of the most exciting recent releases—a model with native agentic capabilities, making it a natural fit for the AIPC. With OpenVINO.GenAI , we’ve been able to accelerate generation by ~1.3× using speculative decoding with a lightweight Qwen3-0.6B draft.

The need for watermarking has become even more critical as people all over the world have begun to generate and share AI-generated images, video, audio, and text. Images and video have become so realistic that they’re nearly impossible to distinguish from what you’d see captured by a real camera. Addressing this issue is multi-faceted, but there is one, clear, low-hanging fruit 🍇: In order for people to know what's real and what's synthetic, use visible watermarks. To help out, we at Hugging Face have made visible watermarking trivially easy: Whenever you create a Space like an app or a demo , you can use our in-house app-building library Gradio to display watermarks with a single command.
