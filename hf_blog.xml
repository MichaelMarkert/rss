For each request and each generated token, we run an inference of a multi-billion parameters model.

What if it could edit images for you, browse the web, or organize your email inbox? Well, now it can! In this blog post, I'll show you: What the MCP protocol is and how it works similarly to the smartphone apps we're all used to, but for LLMs. How you can find thousands of MCP servers via the "MCP App Store." How to add one of these servers to your favorite LLM of choice to grant it a new ability. We'll work through an example using Flux.1 Kontext[dev] which edits images from plain text instructions.
